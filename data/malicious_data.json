Within the past several months, I was observing you.\nAre you still surprised how could that happen? Frankly speaking, malware has infected your devices and it's coming from an adult website, which you used to visit. Although all this stuff may seem unfamiliar to you, but let me try to explain that to you. With aid of Trojan Viruses, I managed to gain full access to any PC or other types of devices.\nThat merely means that I can watch you whenever I want via your screen just by activating your camera as well as microphone, while you don't even know about that. Moreover, I have also received access to entire contacts list as well as full correspondence of yours. You may be wondering, However, my PC is protected by a legitimate antivirus, so how could that happen? Why couldn't I get any alerts? To be honest, the reply is quite straightforward: malware of mine utilizes drivers, which update the signatures on 4hourly basis, which turns them to become untraceable, and hereby making your antivirus remain idle. I have collected a video on the left screen where you enjoy wanking, while the video on the right screen shows the video you were watching at that point of time.\nStill puzzled how much damage could that cause? One mouse click is enough for me to share this video to your social networks, as well as email contacts of yours.\nIn addition, I am also able to gain access to all email correspondence as well as messengers used by you.

I'll explain what led to all of this. have used a Zero Day vulnerability with a special code to infect your device through a website. This is a complicated software that requires precise skills that have. It works as a chain with specially crafted and unique code and thats why this type of an attack can go\nundetected. You only need one not patched vulnerability to be infected, and unfortunately for you it works that simple. You were not targeted specifically, but just became one of the quite a few unlucky people who got hacked that day.\nAll of this happened a few month ago. So I've had time to collect information on you. think you already know what is going to happen next.\nDuring that time, my software was quietly collecting information about your habits, websites that you visit, searches you do, texts you send.\nThere is more to it, but have listed a few reasons for you to understand how serious this is. For you to clearly understand, my software controlled your camera and microphone as well and it was impossible for you to know about it.\nIt was just about right timing for me to get you privacy violated. I've been waiting enough and have decided that it's time to put an end to this. So here is my offer. need a consulting fee to delete the media content have been collecting. Your privacy stays untouched, if get paid. Otherwise, will leak the most damaging content to your contacts and post it to a public tube for perverts to explore. understand how damaging this will be for you, and amount is not that big for you to keep your privacy.\nPlease dont blame me we all have different ways of making a living. have no intention of destroying your reputation or life, but only if get paid. don't care about you personally, that's why you can be sure that all files have and software on your device will be deleted immediately after receive the transfer. only care about getting paid. My modest consulting fee is 1650 US Dollars transferred in Bitcoin. Exchange rate at the time of the transfer.\nYou need to send that amount to this wallet: 17z8  The fee is non negotiable, to be transferred within 2 business days.\nWe use Bitcoin to protect my identity. Obviously do not try to ask for any help from anybody unless you want your privacy to be violated. will monitor your every move until get paid. If you keep your end of the agreement, you wont hear from me ever again. Take care.", "ransomwhere_notes/1652881310416ransomware.txt": "Hello! Unfortunately, I have some unpleasant news for you.\nRoughly several months ago I have managed to get a complete access to all devices that you use to browse internet.\nAfterwards, I have proceeded with monitoring all internet activities of yours. You can check out the sequence of events summarize below: Previously I have bought from hackers a special access to various email accounts currently, it is rather a straightforward thing that can be done online.\nClearly, I could effortlessly log in to your email account as well REPLACEDLINK One week after that, I proceeded with installing a Trojan virus in Operating Systems of all your devices, which are used by you to login to your email.\nActually, that was rather a simple thing to do because you have opened a few links from your inbox emails previously.\nGenius is in simplicity. Thanks to that software I can get access to all controllers inside your devices such as your video camera, microphone, keyboard REPLACEDLINK I could easily download all your data, photos, web browsing history and other information to my servers.\nI can access all your social networks accounts, messengers, emails, including chat history as well as contacts list.\nThis virus of mine unceasingly keeps refreshing its signatures since it is controlled by a driver, and as result stays unnoticed by antivirus software. Hereby, I believe by this time it is already clear for you why I was never detected until I sent this REPLACEDLINK While compiling all the information related to you, I have also found out that you are a true fan and frequent visitor of adult websites.\nYou truly enjoy browsing through porn websites, while watching arousing videos and experiencing an unimaginable satisfaction.\nTo be honest, I could not resist but to record some of your kinky solo sessions and compiled them in several videos, which demonstrate you masturbating and cumming in the end. If you still don't trust me, all it takes me is several mouse clicks to distribute all those videos with your colleagues, friends and even relatives.\nIn addition, I can upload them online for entire public to access.\nI truly believe, you absolutely don't want such things to occur, bearing in mind the kinky stuff exposed in those videos that you usually watch, you definitely understand what I am trying to say it will result in a complete disaster for you. We can still resolve it in the following manner:\nYou perform a transfer of 1590 USD to me a bitcoin equivalent based on the exchange rate during the funds transfer, so after I receive the transfer, I will straight away remove all those lecherous videos without hesitation.\nThen we can pretend like it has never happened before. In addition, I assure that all the harmful software will be deactivated and removed from all devices of yours. Don't worry, I am a man of my word. It is really a good deal with a considerably low the price, bearing in mind that I was monitoring your profile as well as traffic over an extended period.\nIf you still unaware about the purchase and transfer process of bitcoins all you can do is find the necessary information online. My bitcoin wallet is as follows:  You are left with 48 hours and the countdown starts right after you open this email 2 days to be specific. Don't forget to keep in mind and abstain from doing the following: Do not attempt to reply my email this email was generated in your inbox together with the return address. Do not attempt to call police as well as other security services. Moreover, don't even think of sharing it with your friends. If I get to know about it based on my skills, that would be very easy, since that I have all your systems under my control and constant monitoring your dirty video will become public without delay. Don't attempt searching for me it is completely useless. Cryptocurrency transactions always remain anonymous. Don't attempt reinstalling the OS of your devices or even getting rid of them. It is meaningless too, because all your private videos are already been available on remote servers. Things you should be concerned about: That I will not receive the funds transfer you make.\nRelax, I will be able to track it immediately, after you complete the funds transfer, because I unceasingly monitor all activities that you do trojan virus of mine can control remotely all processes, same as TeamViewer. That I will still distribute your videos after you have sent the money to me. Believe me, it is pointless for me to proceed with troubling you after that. Besides that, if that really was my intention, it would happen long time ago! It all will be settled on fair conditions and terms!
