diy_How to Create a Robotic Dog With 9G Servos_train3,"Introduction: How to Create a Robotic Dog With 9G Servos
This is a Robotic Dog inspired by Boston Dynamic's Spotmini, but this time on a much smaller scale. This version of the robotic dog is created with a dozen Servos and some other components such as an Ardurino Nano.
You can find a great instructable covering how to create your own Servo Tester here: REPLACEDLINK Tester2 Step 1: Arrangement of Servos Kinematics
It is best if the Servos are arranged at 90 and then mounted on the legs.
For kinematics:
All Legs 48mm
Shoulder to Shoulder Pivot 40mm Left to Right
Shoulder to Shoulder Pivot 80mm Front to Back
With 90 being centered and perpendicular when assembled:
Shoulder Pivot REPLACEDLINK Left Right
Shoulder Pivot REPLACEDLINK REPLACEDLINK Front Back
Knee Pivot: 70 73 Front Back

This is so weird to find; why create an insturctables from my incomplete project 2 years after I posted it?

You do not need the 16ch servo shield the Arduino NANO is totally capable of driving 20 servos all by itself.",0
diy_How to Create a Robotic Dog With 9G Servos_train5,"Code is here: REPLACEDLINK You can power the servos directly from 6v or REPLACEDLINK or more on their power line, with their data line and GND connected to the Arduino and it drives them fine as well.
They literally just plug in along the sides of the NANO too! see pic
NOTE! I do NOT recommend trying to build this with 9g servos they are too weak they only just barely can carry their own weight if you add a battery or anything else, your dog will sit spreadeagled and go nowhere. Use metalgear hightorque MG995 or MG996 servos instead.

diy_3D Printed Remote Controlled BB8 Droid - Make Course_train35,"Introduction: 3D Printed Remote Controlled BB8 Droid Make Course
This instructable was created in fulfillment of the project requirement of the Makecourse at the University of South Florida REPLACEDLINK Hello Guys,
This is my final project for the Make Course at USF. We were able to build anything we wanted, as long as it operated with the Arduino platform. With Star Wars being a big thing right now, I decided to create my own BB8 Droid. I'll show you the process of how I created the BB8 Droid.
Step 1: Design and 3D Print
Designing is the first step in figuring out how your project will work. For me, I gathered a bunch of ideas online and put my ideas to work. I used AutoCAD Inventor to design the BB8 Droid and",0
diy_3D Printed Remote Controlled BB8 Droid - Make Course_train36,"all the files are available below. My approach was similar to some designs, but with some minor twists. All the parts were 3D printed for this project. The BB8 CoreBody file will be the core of the project, it will house the electronics and be the main focus point of this project. The BB8 CoreBody Motor 1 file is an additional file to use if you are using different motors. The BB8 CoreTop file is the top piece to the body. The Arduino will be screwed down onto it and will also have the magnets and support wheels attached to it. The Top Custom Wheel file are the wheels that will be used a supports. They will connect to the top part in the side slots. The BB8",0
diy_3D Printed Remote Controlled BB8 Droid - Make Course_train37,"Design Thread 1 2 are the half spheres that have threaded ends and can be screwed together. These will eventually encase the core and will roll around. The BB8 Head file is the head of the droid. This will attach to the ball by using magnets. There are pockets that were created to fit magnets into them.
I added both the AutoDesk Inventor file and the STL file. So you can open and change the file however you need it or you can go ahead and print what I have here.

Step 2: Gather Materials
Deciding on parts can take some time, so you want to make sure you get the right ones. For this project, I wanted to get components that were simple to use. Below, you can see all",0
diy_3D Printed Remote Controlled BB8 Droid - Make Course_train38,"the parts I needed to get my BB8 rolling. Arduino Uno R3 L298N Motor Driver MPU6050 Accelerometer Gyroscope HC06 Wireless Bluetooth Module REPLACEDLINK Lipo Battery Lipo Battery Charger 2 17mm Rubber Wheel REPLACEDLINK Bore 2 10mm x 3mm Neodymium Magnets REPLACEDLINK metal rod Female to Male Wire Jumpers Resistors 2 36v DC Motors REPLACEDLINK Shaft Lead Weights Circuit Wire 4 2mm Screws 4 REPLACEDLINK Screws 4 3mm Screws 2 2mm Washers All Purpose Putty Contact Cemente Smartphone Super Glue Grey Primer Spray Paint Black, White, Orange, Grey, Clear Spray Paint Plastidip or Flexidip Breadboards Micro Breadboard Velcro Strips Precision Bit Screwdriver Set Dremel Electric Drill 2mm, REPLACEDLINK 3mm Drill Bits Electrical Tape Painters Tape 120 Grit, 200 Grit Sandpaper
Step 3: Build the Circuit
Breadboarding and testing the circuit is",0
diy_3D Printed Remote Controlled BB8 Droid - Make Course_train39,"always a good step to do. It allows you to find any problems and or make changes. I did this to verify proper operation of each component and also to test out code.
MPU6050 Accelerometer Gyroscope:
This device will be used to determine the angle of the BB8 head. In order to keep the head in the upright position.
HC06 BlueTooth Module:
This device will be used to accept direction commands from the phone to the Arduino to control the motors on the BB8 Core. A voltage divider will need to be used to protect the HC06 from the high voltage on the Arduino. Check out the circuit diagram to see the configuration.
L298N Motor Driver:
This device is used to control the two DC motors with PWM signals from the Arduino. The motors",0
diy_3D Printed Remote Controlled BB8 Droid - Make Course_train40,"will operate to the desired directions from the app and the readings from the MPU6050.
Arduino:
The Arduino Uno will be used as the brain for the whole system. The code is designed to bring all the functionality of the devices together and work in a orderly function.
I will explain the functionality of my circuit below:
The smartphone will use the Joystick BlueTooth Commander app to connect to the HC06 and send direction commands to the Arduino. The Arduino will read these values from the HC06 and send a response to the L298N motor driver. The motor driver will begin to spin the wheels forwards or backwards, based on the sent signal. The MPU6050 Accelerometer Gyroscope will keep track of the angle position BB8 is currently in. If the angle reaches",0
diy_3D Printed Remote Controlled BB8 Droid - Make Course_train41,"past a threshold, once the system stops, the motor driver will automatically turn the motors on in the needed direction to get to the upright position. To turn left or right, the system will operate similar to that of a tank. If you want to turn, one of the motors will need to slow down in order to create a turning direction.
Step 4: Prepare the Code
In order to use this code, you will need a couple libraries for the Arduino IDE. You will need the PID, I2CDev, and MPU6050 libraries. These libraries were created by some smart people, so be sure to thank them. Jeff Rowberg created the libraries for the MPU6050 and I2CDev. Brett Beauregard created the PID library. I took the time to go through the",0
diy_3D Printed Remote Controlled BB8 Droid - Make Course_train42,"example and header files to fully understand the code and figure out how it all works. To start, upload these libraries to your Arduino IDE. Start with the MPU6050, we will need to test and calibrate this device before operation. To test it, use the example code in the MPU6050 folder under Example MPU6050DMP6. This code will allow you to test the device and verify proper operation. The code is set to display the yaw, pitch, and roll data to you through the serial port on the Arduino. Once testing is completed and successful, open the MPU6050 calibration folder and open the Arduino file. This file will calibrate the MPU6050 to its given position, so be sure to place it on a flat surface. The calibration time can",0
diy_3D Printed Remote Controlled BB8 Droid - Make Course_train43,"take a few minutes, if it freezes up just restart it. It will give you offset values that will set your MPU6050 close to the zero origin, the only value that is large is the Zaxis accelerometer value because of gravity. Take these values and plug them into the code for the MPU6050DMP6 raw test. Your readings should be a lot more accurate. The HC06 device can be configured to display a desired name, have a desired password, and operate at a desired baud rate. To change this, use the BlueToothExampleCode file. Take a look at the PDF provided, this includes commands that will allow you to change the name and baud rate of the device. Changing the name of the device is optional, but I recommend changing",0
diy_3D Printed Remote Controlled BB8 Droid - Make Course_train44,"the baud rate to 57600. All commands will be sent through the serial port on the Arduino IDE once the HC06 is connected and the code is uploaded and running. The app that I used for this project is called the Joystick Bluetooth Commander. This app is available on the Google app store. If you decide to use any other bluetooth application, you will need to use different code. Use the BlueToothJoystickAppCode file to test that you are obtaining data from the app. You will need to pair the HC06 device with your phone prior to testing. The code for the HC06 will most likely be 1234 or 0000 by default To test the motors, use the MotorCodeExample file. This file will allow you to run the motors",0
diy_3D Printed Remote Controlled BB8 Droid - Make Course_train45,"and determine smallest PWM signal that will get them to start turning. Tuning the motors is needed because not all motors start or turn at the same rate.
Once all the initial testing is completed, you can move on to the NewBB8Code file. You will need to verify pin connections, MPU6050 offsets, and HC06 baud rate. Once that is done, you can upload the code and test everything out. The code is designed to allow the user to control the direction that BB8 will role while keeping the head in the upright position. The PID will need to be tuned but cant be until the core is assembled.
I will explain the functions of the code below: initimu; This is used to initiate the MPU6050 and set the ideal settings.",0
diy_3D Printed Remote Controlled BB8 Droid - Make Course_train46,"This was taken from the MPU6050 example code. motorSetup; This is used to set all the pins for the motor driver to outputs. getValues; This is used to obtain the readings for the yaw, pitch, and roll from the MPU6050. blueTooth; This is used to setup the HC06 and receive the data from the app on the phone. pidCompute; This is used to run the PID controller in order to tune to the setpoint and produce a PWM signal for the motors. motorControl; This is used to control BB8 in the desired direction and also send PWM signals to keep the head in the upward position.

Step 5: Assemble the Core
The inside of the BB8 Droid is what I like to call the Core. It houses all the components",0
diy_3D Printed Remote Controlled BB8 Droid - Make Course_train47,"and is the main part for getting BB8 to roll. Start with placing the motors in the side pockets of the core, feed the wiring through the premade holes and place the wheels on the motor shaft. Use the Electric Drill to make premade holes for the L298N Motor Driver, MPU6050, and the Arduino Uno. Place the L298N Motor Driver inside the core and screw it down. Connect the motor wires to the L298N. Place the MPU6050 on the side platform and screw it down. Place the HC06 Bluetooth Module on the other side platform, it doesn't have screw holes so I used Velcro strips to hold it down. Place the REPLACEDLINK Lipo battery in the pocket near the front. Make sure the wires are out in the",0
diy_3D Printed Remote Controlled BB8 Droid - Make Course_train48,"open. Now use the Dremel and cut little holes on the sides on the top piece of the core. This will be used to feed wires through. Connect all the female to male jumper wires to the components, I used electrical tape to keep the wires clean and organized. Create a voltage divider out of the Receive signal for the HC06. This is needed to protect the HC06 from high voltage Arduino signal. Use the micro breadboard and two resistors to do this. The Receive wire from the Arduino will connect to the larger resistor. The smaller resistor will connect to the other end of the larger resistor and to the ground. The Receive wire for the HC06 will connect to the Receive pin on the HC06 and",0
diy_3D Printed Remote Controlled BB8 Droid - Make Course_train49,"the connecting point between the two resistors. Make sure the L298N Power and Ground wires are out in the open too. Feed all the wires through the holes of the top piece, be sure to manage them nicely and place them closes to the Arduino pin it will be connecting to. Screw down the top piece to the core, keep in mind the power and ground wires from the L298N and battery need to be hanging to the side. Start connecting the wires to the correct Arduino pins. You may have to look back inside the core to see where the wire is coming from. The 3D printed wheels need to be sprayed with Plastidip or Flexidip, I did this to provide a little bit of traction to",0
diy_3D Printed Remote Controlled BB8 Droid - Make Course_train50,"them. Take the metal rod and place it into the premade holes on the top part of the core. Measure how long the piece needs to be to get from one hole to the other. It should be about 12mm. Cut the piece off, this will be used as the axle for the 3D printed wheels. Place a washer towards the outside of the wheels on the axle. This helps the wheels from rubbing on the side brace. Glue the axle in with super glue or contact cement. Glue the neodymium magnets in the top pockets of the top core piece. Magnets will also be placed in the pockets on BB8's head. Place a soft part of the Velcro strip on the front and back end of the",0
diy_3D Printed Remote Controlled BB8 Droid - Make Course_train51,"core, this will help with noise. Use the Dremel to cut pockets in the bottom of the core, this is where the lead weights will go. This will work as a counter balance.
Now the core should be assembled, I designed it this way to allow easy access to program the Arduino and charging the battery.
Step 6: Prepare the Ball and Head
3D printing is not always perfect. The half sphere prints were a little warped from the printing process, so I used the putty and filled in holes, divots, and bumps. Once the putty is dry, use the sandpaper to smooth it out and create a nice even circle shape. To begin painting, we need to prime. Use the primer to spray the sphere pieces and head with it.",0
diy_3D Printed Remote Controlled BB8 Droid - Make Course_train52,"Put on a good first coat and wait for it to dry. Once dry, do some wet sanding. This will help to hide the 3D print layer look from the pieces. Add one more coat of primer to all the pieces. Wait for a complete dry. Grab the white spray paint and paint outside of the spheres and the head. Use the painters tape to avoid places you don't want the paint, like the inside of the spheres and the threads. Wait until a complete dry. Use scissors and cut out the stencils for the BB8 designs. Screw the two shperes together. Start with the inner circle design, place the stencil on the ball and use the grey spray paint to create the design. You will do this",0
diy_3D Printed Remote Controlled BB8 Droid - Make Course_train53,"six times. Let the paint dry before moving on to the next one. Once done with the grey designs, cut out the inner part of the orange circle. This will be used as a shield for the grey designs. Cover the grey design with the inner stencil, use painters tape where needed. Create a outer circle stencil, this will be used to make the orange circle the right size. Once the stencils are placed, use the orange spray paint. Wait for a complete dry before moving on to the next one. You will do this six times. To paint the BB8 head, I used the painters tape to create the designs. I covered the rest of the head with tape to avoid getting the paint in the wrong",0
diy_3D Printed Remote Controlled BB8 Droid - Make Course_train54,"areas. You will have to wait for the paint to dry before moving on to the next design. Once the paint is fully dried, cover that spot with painters tape and work on the next design. Once both parts are fully painted, use the clear coat spray and apply a layer of paint on the ball and head. Wait for a complete dry before adding another coat. This is used to protect the spray paint from getting scratches when rolling around. Use the Plastidip or Flexidip and spray a thin layer inside the two half sphere pieces. Use painters tape to avoid getting the spray on the threads and outside of the ball. This is used to provide a decent grip for the wheels on the core. To",0
diy_3D Printed Remote Controlled BB8 Droid - Make Course_train55,"finalize the head, cut a white jumper wire in half and super glue it to the back part of the head. This will act as an antenna for BB8. Use another white jumper wire for the other antenna too.
You should now have a fully painted BB8 that is ready for operation.
Step 7: Bring It All Together
Now that the code is set up, the core is assembled, and the ball and head are finished, lets bring it all together and get a working project. Tuning the PID controller will be included in this step. Place the core inside the half sphere, make sure that the wheels touch the inside of the sphere. Make sure there is some pressure but not too much, the core needs to be able to",0
diy_3D Printed Remote Controlled BB8 Droid - Make Course_train56,"grab the ball but also be able to move. Plug in the battery on the core and upload the NewBB8Code file. This will be used to tune the PID controller. Screw the other half of the sphere on to enclose the core inside the ball. Place the head on top of the ball where the magnets are. To tune the PID controller, there is a long but decent way to approach it. For those who don't know a PID controller is used to determine what speed the motors should run so the BB8 head will be in the upright position. The PID controller will have an input, output, and setpoint. The input will come from the MPU6050. The setpoint is the desired angle of the head, in this",0
diy_3D Printed Remote Controlled BB8 Droid - Make Course_train57,"case 0 degrees is desired. The output is the changed input to get close to the setpoint. Set all PID constants to zero. Slowly increase the Pconstant value. Keep increasing this until the motors respond quickly to tilting. Now increase the Iconstant. This should be a low value. It accumulates errors quickly over time. Raise the Dconstant. The derivative component works against motion, so it helps to dampen any oscillations and reduce overshooting. Spend a good amount of time tuning the PID controller until the motors respond smoothly to movement. Now once the PID controller is tuned, you should be able to connect the app to the HC06, upload the correct code, and begin to start attempting to control your BB8. Some issues may come up that need",0
diy_3D Printed Remote Controlled BB8 Droid - Make Course_train58,"to be worked out. A major issue that happened to me was that the magnets were to strong and lifted the core inside the ball. This prevented the bottom wheels from touching the inside of the ball, so BB8 wasn't able to roll. To fix this, try extending out the motors from the pocket their in so that the wheels touch the inside of the ball. This is what fixed my problem.
The BB8 should be ready to go. Get the battery all charged up and connected to the phone. Start trying to control him and drive him where desired. If all goes well, BB8 should roll around at a nice smooth rate. If problems occur, do your best to determine the issue and fix it.
Step 8: Possible Improvements
Implement",0
diy_3D Printed Remote Controlled BB8 Droid - Make Course_train59,"an Xaxis Balancing System in Code: The BB8 Droid currently only reacts to Yaxis changes. So to correct the head position, the motors will just simply spin in the forward or backwards position based on the current angle. Some of the code is already added to implement an Xaxis system but it will require a little more time to figure out a good coding approach.
Find Better Drive Wheels: The wheels I am currently using tend to slip a little bit and shred easily. Maybe finding a firmer rubber material will help. It was the only 17mm wheel I could find at the time.
Use Higher Torque Motors: With the motors I am using now, the BB8 droid sometimes needs a little push to get going. Finding high torque motors",0
diy_3D Printed Remote Controlled BB8 Droid - Make Course_train60,"of small size is hard to find. Another option is to use a gearing system.
Include BB8 Sounds: I found audio files of all the different BB8 sounds. If someone wanted to they could create a little sound box to play these audio files. This wouldn't be to bad to implement because the app has six buttons that can be programmed to do anything. They could be used to play these audio files when the button is pressed. All you would need is another Arduino Uno, SD card reader adapter, Speaker, Black Box, wires, and a 9v battery.

Looks great!
A possible alternative for wheels could be taken from old computer scroll wheels. The rubber is molded to hold on wheels and is pretty durable. The hard part would be finding a pair.

diy_Weather Station_train87,"Introduction: Weather Station
Ever feel uncomfortable during small talk? Need cool things to talk okay, brag about? Well we have the thing for you! This tutorial will allow you to build and use your very own weather station. Now you can confidently fill any awkward silence with updates on the temperature, pressure, humidity, altitude and wind speed. Never again will you resort to the bland, weather's been nice once you complete this neat project.
Our weather station is fully equipped in a water resistant box with different sensors that record various natural measurements and save them all to the same SD card. An Arduino Uno is used to easily code the weather station so that it can work remotely. In addition, any number of sensors can be added or integrated",0
diy_Weather Station_train88,"into the system to give it an array of different functionalities. We decided to use various sensors from Adafruit: we used a DHT22 Temperature and Humidity sensor, a BMP280 barometric pressure and altitude sensor, and an anemometer wind speed sensor. We had to download several code libraries in addition to piecing together some different codes to get all of our sensors to run together and log data on the SD card. The links to the libraries are commented in our code.
Step 1: Gather Materials Arduino Uno Protoboard 9V Battery Adafruit Anemometer Wind Speed Sensor Waterproof Housing Adafruit BMP280 Barometric Pressure and Altitude Sensor Adafruit DHT22 Temperature and Humidity Sensor Adafruit Assembled Data Logging Shield Hot Glue
It is important at this step to just make sure that your Arduino",0
diy_Weather Station_train89,"is working and can be programmed from your computer. We also ended up soldering all of our components to a protoboard, but a breadboard can also be used to connect the sensor to the Arduino. Our protoboard made all of our connections permanent and made it easier to house the components without worrying about jostling them out of place.
Step 2: Add a Data Logger
This step is easy peasy. All you have to do to accomplish this step is snap the data logger in place. It fits right on top of the Arduino Uno.
Getting the data logger to actually log data requires some coding. The logger records the data to a SD card that fits into the shield and can be removed and plugged into a computer. One feature",0
diy_Weather Station_train90,"of the code that is helpful is the utilization of the time stamp. The time clock records the day, month and year in addition to the second, minute and hour as long as it's hooked up to the battery. We had to set that time in the code when we started, but the data logger keeps the time as long as the battery on its board is connected. This means no resetting of the clock!
Step 3: Set Up the Temperature and Humidity Sensor Connect the first pin red on the sensor to the 5V pin on the Arduino Connect the second pin blue to a digital pin on the Arduino we put ours in pin 6 Wire the fourth pin green to the ground of the Arduino
The sensor",0
diy_Weather Station_train91,"from Adafruit that we used only needs one digital pin on the Arduino to collect data. This sensor is a capacitive humidity sensor. What this means is that it measures the relative humidity with two metal electrodes separated by a porous dielectric material between them. As water enters the pores, the capacitance is altered. The temperature sensing portion of the sensor is a simple resistor: the resistance changes as the temperature changes termed a thermistor. Although the change is nonlinear, it can be translated into a temperature reading that is recorded by our data logger shield.
Step 4: Set Up the Pressure and Altitude Sensor The Vin pin red gets connected to the 5V pin on the Arduino The second pin isn't connected to anything The GND pin black",0
diy_Weather Station_train92,"is connected to the ground on the Arduino The SCK pin yellow runs to the SCL pin on the Arduino The fifth pin isn't connected The SDI pin blue is connected to the Arduino's SDA pin The seventh pin isn't connected and isn't pictured on the diagram
The Vin pin regulates the voltage to the sensor itself and takes it down from 5V input to 3V. The SCK pin, or the SPI Clock Pin, is an input pin to the sensor. The SDI pin is the serial data in pin and carries the information from the Arduino to the sensor. In the diagram of the Arduino and breadboard setup, the pressure and altitude sensor pictured wasn't the exact model we used. There is one less pin, however, the way",0
diy_Weather Station_train93,"that it is wired is the exact same as the way that the actual sensor was wired. The way the pins are connected reflects the pins on the sensor, and should provide an adequate model for the setup of the sensor.
Step 5: Set Up the Anemometer The red power line from the anemometer needs to be connected to the Vin pin on the Arduino The black ground line should be connected to the ground on the Arduino The blue wire in our circuit was connected to the A2 pin
One important thing to consider is that the anemometer requires 724V of power to run. The 5V pin on the Arduino just isn't going to cut it. So, a 9V battery must be plugged into the Arduino. This directly connects",0
diy_Weather Station_train94,"to the Vin pin and allows the anemometer to draw from a larger power source. The anemometer measures windspeed by creating an electrical current. The faster it spins, the more energy, and thus the more current, the anemometer sources. The Arduino is able to translate the electrical signal it receives to a wind speed. The program we coded also does the necessary conversion to get the wind speed into miles per hour.
Step 6: Check the Circuit and Run Some Tests
Pictured above is our completed circuit diagram. The temperature sensor is the white, fourpinned sensor in the middle of the board. The pressure sensor is represented by the red sensor on the right. Although it doesn't match the sensor we used exactly, the pins connections will match up if",0
diy_Weather Station_train95,"you align them left to right there is one more pin on the sensor we used than in the diagram. The anemometer's wires matched the colors we assigned them in the diagram. In addition, we added the 9V battery to the black battery port in the bottom left corner of the diagram on the Arduino.
To test the weather station, try breathing on the temperature and humidity sensor, spin the anemometer, and take data at the top and bottom of a tall building hill to see if the temperature sensor, anemometer, and pressure altitude sensor are collecting data. Try taking the SD card out and plugging in into a device to make sure the measurements were recorded properly. Hopefully everything is running smoothly. If not, double check all of",0
diy_Weather Station_train96,"your connections. As a backup plan, try checking the code and seeing if any errors have been made.
Attachments
Step 7: House All the Components
Now's the time to make it look like a real weather station. We used an Outdoor Products waterproof box to house our circuit and most of the components. Our box already had a hole in the side with a penetrator and a rubber gasket. This allowed us to run the temperature sensor and the anemometer's wires outside of the box through a hole drilled in the penetrator and sealed with epoxy. To solve the issue of housing the pressure sensor inside the box, we drilled small holes in the very bottom of the box and put a riser on each corner of the bottom to keep",0
diy_Weather Station_train97,"it sitting above ground level.
To waterproof the wires connecting the anemometer and temperature sensor to the main circuit board, we used heat shrink tape to seal any connections. We ran the temperature sensor beneath the box and attached it we just didn't want the tinted plastic to trap heat and give us false temperature readings.
This isn't the only housing option, but it's definitely one that'll get the job done for a fun project.
Step 8: Enjoy Your Personal Little Weather Station!
Now's the fun part! Take your weather station around with you, set it up outside your window, or do whatever else you'd like. Want to send it up in a weather balloon? Check out our next Instructable!

diy_GoPro Waterproof Time Lapse Box_train116,"Introduction: GoPro Waterproof Time Lapse Box
I searched the Internet high and low for something to mount my gopro camera too, in order to shoot extremely long term time lapse footage. I had ideas of converting a trail cam box, to just attaching the camera to a tree. The latter was just asking for me to get my camera stolen.
After weeks of searching and no luck, I decided to build my own. It is not only waterproof, but secure and safe as well. here is how I did it.
Step 1:
Step 2: Find a Box
First I order a Pelican 1120 box from Amazon. The most expensive part of the build, but also the main part as well. About 30
Step 3: Find a Lens Adapter
I then ordered a 52mm lens adapter",0
diy_GoPro Waterproof Time Lapse Box_train117,"for the camera. I also went to Amazon and found one that came WITH a UV lens and a couple extra filters. mainly for protection more than for their intended purpose. About 12
Step 4: Cut a Hole for the Adapter
I then used a utility knife to cut a square hole in the box, small enough a to barely squeeze the adapter through so that it would snugly fit without glue. I then used marine waterproof caulk to seal any gaps.
Step 5: Drill Holes to Attach Mounting Hardware
In my situation, I was mounting my camera to a REPLACEDLINK square pipe. Therefore, I turned the box over and drilled holes into the existing mounting screw areas. Picked up a couple U bolts and slipped them into place. 5
You could just",0
diy_GoPro Waterproof Time Lapse Box_train118,"as easily drill these holes and mount a metal bracket to be used as a mounting device.
Step 6: Build Mounting Base
In order to mount the camera to the box, I needed raise the platform inside the box. I wanted to be able to close the lid and have the camera FLUSH with the adapter. I used a 1x6 piece of pine and cut it to fit inside the box. I Drilled the holes through the back to allow passage of the u bolts. This wasn't quite deep enough, I still needed about an 1 8 raise to get flush. I used a scrap piece of plywood that worked perfectly.
I then used the mount that came with the camera. It's the one that actually held the camera in the",0
diy_GoPro Waterproof Time Lapse Box_train119,"box attached to the cardboard box for display. I drilled a few holes and used some washers with wood screws to keep it in place.
Step 7: Cut Passage for USB Cable
Next, I drilled a couple holes in the bottom of the box and then used a utility a knife to square up the hole. All to be able to pass the USB cable through.
When it was finished, I used the marine grade caulk to seal the hole up.
Step 8: Purchase a Dummy Battery
Which brings me to why I need the hole.
I purchased a Switronix DVGP3 GoPro battery adapter. It replaces the actual battery which has a very short life span it has a USB attachment and provides constant longer power to the camera from a car battery. 23
In",0
diy_GoPro Waterproof Time Lapse Box_train120,"my case, I used an old lawn mower battery and put it in a battery box from a boat.
When you use this adapter, the standard door to the gopro case will not close. You will need to use the one with the rectangle openings in the top and bottom. My camera came with this extra door.
Step 9: Purchase a 12V Converter
Now, In order to hook it up to the battery, you will need a power converter. There are hundreds out there. I chose a Dual 2 USB Port Power Charger Socket 12V 1A REPLACEDLINK Outlet. 15 It's made for motorcycles and works great. Hook it straight up to the battery, then hook the camera battery to the USB port.
Step 10: DONE
Hook everything up and test it out.
I also",0
diy_GoPro Waterproof Time Lapse Box_train121,"attached 2 Master Locks to try to keep out unwanted fingers.
TIP:
If you desire longer than 1min intervals in your Time Lapse, you need to use this EASY hack from Konrad Iturbe REPLACEDLINK It's called Megalapse!
Get it here. REPLACEDLINK Select your camera and follow the directions.
Happy Lapsing!!!

Great setup. Looking to do something similar for the build of my house. Curious if you would share a few things:
1. What size memory did you use and how often did you have to download and clear it?
2. Did you use any type of scheduler to try and reserve power and memory at night?

I used a 32g card all I had at the time I actually used 2, replaced the full one with a clean one.
I checked",0
diy_GoPro Waterproof Time Lapse Box_train122,"it more times than I technically needed to. But it seems that the camera kept turning itself off. I don't know if the neighbors were unplugging the battery or if the camera itself had a glitch, but it was annoying. So I checked it about every other day or so. But when it worked, I think it took 10,000 photos if I'm not mistaken, before it would become full. Easy math will tell you what you can get out of a card. Just take a couple practice shots at peak day and at night when its black.
The peak day will of course be larger, but the night time black pictures will be very small. You should be able to calculate from there.
I did not use a scheduler, but",0
diy_GoPro Waterproof Time Lapse Box_train123,"I did contemplate using a program you can install on the camera that will let you take shots at any increment you desire. But after loading it in and messing with it, I realized for my purpose, I would not need anything other than the program made with the camera.
Hope that helps! Thanks!!

Really great setup!
I'm curious as to how long the car battery was able to keep the gopro running for.
1 week? 2 weeks?!!?
Reply 5 years ago
wow. very late response. Sorry. I used a Marine Battery. I had it run all night and day. 1pic per min. Battery lasted about 2 weeks.

Thank you! It all depends on the size of the battery and the amount of shots the camera was taking in a",0
diy_GoPro Waterproof Time Lapse Box_train124,"day.
I used a deep cycle battery for a boat and mostly shot 1 picture every minute. at that rate I had 1440 pictures per day. 10080 per week. I tried to charge it every week but had let it go for 2 weeks before. It has been a while ago, if I recall correctly, I could get 2 weeks and that was pushing it.",0

diy_Build a WiFi Enabled Micro-quadrotor_train167,"Introduction: Build a WiFi Enabled Microquadrotor
This instructable just record how simple that build a WiFi enabled microquadrotor youself !
Most of parts can be bought cheap and easily.
And use your Android phone as remotecontroller.
Step 1: Things That Need Prepare
Parts you will need: flight controller board, SP racing F3 EVO Brushed here. 8520 brushed motor 4 65mm blade propeller prop 1S REPLACEDLINK 300600mAh lipo battery ESP01 wifi module any frame for Microqaudrotor, you can DIY or buy from somewhere.
Tools Things that you need: soldering iron solder tape foam tape hot glue any UART to USB bridge to flash ESP01 firmware
Step 2: Flash ESP8266 Firmware and Setting WiFi Module!
Download esplink firmware: REPLACEDLINK link
And flash it via UART to USB bridge.
After flash, reboot ESP01,
and you will find a SSID called ESPXXXXXX.
XXXXXX is",0
diy_Build a WiFi Enabled Micro-quadrotor_train168,"least 3 byte of MAC address of ESP01 module
Connect it, and open REPLACEDLINK in your browser.
Go to Debug log page, set to off.
Go to uC Console page, set Baud to 115200.
And you can also change any other thing you want ex: SSID, REPLACEDLINK wiring image modify from REPLACEDLINK ESP01 pinout image from http: ruten REPLACEDLINK REPLACEDLINK Step 3: Wire and Place All the Things Up!
Step 4: Drone Setting
Note: REPLACEDLINK REPLACEDLINK remove 'RXMSP' for all F3 board, which is needed for control from app. You may need to flash older version or build a 'RXMSP' enable version firmware.
1 connect FC using Clean Betaflight configurator via USB cable depend on what firmware FC used
2 Go to the Ports tab. UART1 row engage the MSP. Save and Reboot
3 Go to the",0
diy_Build a WiFi Enabled Micro-quadrotor_train169,"Configurations tab. Mixer Quad X Receiver Mode RXMSP. Set Motor Stop Min Throttle 1000, Max Throttle 2000, Min Command 1100 Save and Reboot
4 Go to the Modes Tab Set ARM to AUX1 if you wish to arm via AUX1 button. Set Flights Modes Optional. Acro Rate mode is the default, so if you wish to use Angle and Horizon, you will need to set it now. I usually put the Angle mode on AUX2, Horizon on AUX3, Acro Rate mode if both off.
5 the CLI Tab Motor Jitter Start up spinning Type: set motorpwmrate16000 enter. Type: save enter. will auto Reboot.

Note: REPLACEDLINK REPLACEDLINK remove 'RXMSP' for all F3 board, which is needed for control from app. You may need to flash older version or build a 'RXMSP' enable version firmware.
download this app: link1: REPLACEDLINK ud10kmIkSZXhhdFROTndwYWs , link2: REPLACEDLINK controller releases
or you can build yourself: REPLACEDLINK controller
connect to drone's wifi SSID,
open the app called MSPController,
click transmitter icon on lefttop,
type in REPLACEDLINK and click 'connect',
and you see that status will be updated.
and then, arm and fly the quadrotor as your setting!!

Yes I did. I was follow exactly step by step.
I will try with REPLACEDLINK I have connection to esp when I try to connect from inav as a regural UART but won't read any data from FC so I suspect pin out so I try with esp 12 but won't work im waiting for oscilloscope to check signals but I didn't try other versions of esplink.

help I might have obtained from his friends, to have supplied much that
is wanting; but I preferred, and I believe the public will prefer, that
the last thoughts of the great mind passed away from among us should
be preserved sacred from any touch but his own. Besides the revised
manuscript, a few pages containing the first rough sketch of the last
two months of William's reign are all that is left. From this I have
with some difficulty deciphered the account of the death of William. No
attempt has been made to join it on to the preceding part, or to supply
the corrections which would have been given by the improving hand of the
author. But, imperfect as it must be, I believe it will be",0

In a move that surprised absolutely nobody who has been paying attention to whats going on in the digital currency and blockchain industries in recent times, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission CFTC recently sued the founders of Ooki decentralized autonomous organization DAO.
The CFTC accuses Ooki DAO of engaging in activities without proper registration and violating Know Your Customer KYC due diligence requirements and regulations.
In this suit, Ooki DAO is listed as an unincorporated association. This essentially means that its token holders, who vote on the protocol with governance tokens, are operating the legal equivalent of a business.
However, unlike operating an actual business, such as an LLC, running a DAO offers",0
btc_0ba8eb860872bc4c32f892f297aaf641_train218,"no legal protections such as limited liability. This leaves token holders liable for legal violations and potential financial losses.
The move could publicly destroy the widespread delusion within the industry that the socalled decentralization of these systems offers legal immunity.
Decentralization offers no legal protection
The truth is that decentralization is largely a myth promoted by anarchists who have also seen blockchains and digital currencies as a way to evade the law.
Just recently, Ethereums founder Vitalik Buterin was said to be furious at the idea Ethereum validators might comply with OFAC sanctions, suggesting that validators who do should have their ETH stakes burned.
His rainbow shawl twitched violently as he considered the implications of the validators ignoring his commands. Until today his voice had been the law that controlled the code. Witches",0
btc_0ba8eb860872bc4c32f892f297aaf641_train219,"he screeched, his voice breaking high with the effort. Burn their stakes! All of them!!! REPLACEDLINK REPLACEDLINK Brendan Lee @BrendanLee August 22, 2022
If the CFTC is successful in its action against Ooki DAO, this could leave token holders of all kinds, including those involved in governing DAOs, in a precarious position. On the one hand, they could risk having their stakes burned by the community should they choose to comply with legal orders, and on the other hand, they would be legally liable if they did not comply.
In truth, decentralization has never offered legal immunity. This is one of the many pervasive myths that deluded many in the digital currency space. Bitcoins inventor warned about this years ago, and were coming to see his predictions come true in",0
btc_0ba8eb860872bc4c32f892f297aaf641_train220,"the long run.
Blockchain must comply with laws to reach its full potential
While Bitcoin and other blockchains have been hijacked and misrepresented by those who either did not understand them or wished to use them for nefarious purposes, lawsuits like the CFTC action against Ooki DAO should go some way to clearing things up.
Truthfully, it will be a good thing when this critical legal point is demonstrated irrevocably. When legal precedent is set, those who have painted Bitcoin as a tool for criminals and subversion will have one less vector through which they can attack it. Furthermore, corporations, governments, and other vital players will begin to understand the bigger picture of Bitcoins potential.

If Bitcoin and blockchain technology, in general, are ever going to reach their potential as worldtransforming tech, it needs to be clearly demonstrated that existing laws apply and can be enforced. The Ooki DAO token holders being held legally accountable for violating several United States laws and regulations is a good start in that direction.

diy_Hearing Impaired Doorbell Room Light Hack_train273,"Introduction: Hearing Impaired Doorbell Room Light Hack
Problem: my dad is registered as deaf and my mum is hearing impaired and due to this they often find it difficult to hear the doorbell. This could be a problem suffered by many others as well.
They bought a flashing light doorbell to help them with this a small box with a light that flashes when the doorbell is pressed. But that didn't work well enough, if they were in a different room they wouldn't see the light flash, even if they were in the same room they wouldn't see the light flash unless they were already looking at it!
I wanted to use my engineering intuition to build something to really solve the problem!! I built a device that flashes the main",0
diy_Hearing Impaired Doorbell Room Light Hack_train274,"room lights when the doorbell is pressed, that way wherever they are in the house, nomatter which direction they are looking in they will still see the flashing. See video above for demo.
How it works: Person presses doorbell Arduino senses doorbell press via voltage change on doorbell receiver speaker Arduino reacts by closing then opening the light switch 10 times to flash the room lights on and off
Step 1: Order Parts
You'll need these parts: RF light switch remote I've only managed to get this to work with the LightwaveRF switches, it didn't work on a cheap Chinese one from Amazon, I explain why in a later step
This is the that I couldn't get to work with my system: REPLACEDLINK 15
The system I installed in my parents house uses",0
diy_Hearing Impaired Doorbell Room Light Hack_train275,"LightWaveRF light switches, one for each room I want to control. Here is an example: REPLACEDLINK JSJSLW400WH REPLACEDLINK 60 and you will need to buy a remote control too such as: REPLACEDLINK JSJSLW101BLK REPLACEDLINK 60 Arduino nano about 4 for a knock off one from ebay REPLACEDLINK Nanov3 REPLACEDLINK Any wireless doorbell. I used: REPLACEDLINK 7 Plastic box or squeeze the electronics into the battery compartment of the doorbell receiver Opto couplers PC123 REPLACEDLINK REPLACEDLINK REPLACEDLINK each Mains 12V power supply about 10 REPLACEDLINK voltage reg caps if needed to power light switch remote or doorbell receiver I didn't need this because I ran my doorbell receiver off the 5V rail from the Arduino, this was possible because it only drew 80mA and my lightswitch remote worked off",0
diy_Hearing Impaired Doorbell Room Light Hack_train276,"12V from my main supply A good option for a 5V regulator is the LM79 by ST RC low pass filter resistor capacitor to smooth out sense signal from the doorbell receiver. Exact values are not too important because we can filter in the code as well. About REPLACEDLINK Kohm resistor and REPLACEDLINK capacitor will do. REPLACEDLINK Copper matrix board 2x 220 ohm resistors. REPLACEDLINK 1x 10K ohm resistor. REPLACEDLINK And these tools: Arduino nano USB cable Soldering iron solder Glue gun Wire clippers and wire strippers Heat shrink and insulation tape Multimeter for debugging
Step 2: Test Wireless Lightswitch and Doorbell
Test both the wireless doorbell and the wireless light switch.
Install the wireless light switch using the connections shown below and test using the corresponding remote control. ALWAYS REMEMBER",0
diy_Hearing Impaired Doorbell Room Light Hack_train277,"TO TURN OFF THE POWER AT THE CIRCUIT BREAKER BEFORE REMOVING OLD SWITCH.
Wireless light switch wire colour

Put batteries in doorbell and test.
Step 3: Take Remote Controls Apart Take apart the the light switch remote control and the doorbell receiver Then solder a red wire to the 5V input to the doorbell receiver where the battery connected And a black wire to the ground connection
Step 4: Cut Copper Matrix Board to Fit Box
I decided to make things hard for myself and shoehorn all my electronics into the space no longer occupied by the batteries partly because I forgot to buy a plastic project box. If you're attempting this unnecessarily difficult task you will need to prep some matrix board to the",0
diy_Hearing Impaired Doorbell Room Light Hack_train278,"size of your battery compartment.
An easy technique for cutting matrix board is to snap it against a sharp table edge see pictures and it should break cleanly along a strip of holes. Then file edges smooth
Step 5: Build the Circuit :D
There are two main parts to this circuit to build and I would recommend building them individually and testing as you go: REPLACEDLINK Sensing a doorbell press which I have done by reading the voltage of the speaker this approach will work for any doorbell REPLACEDLINK Hacking the buttons of the lightswitch remote control so that the button is switched by the Arduino to mimic someone pressing the button REPLACEDLINK Any voltage regulators that you might need to step down the 12V from the supply to a lower",0
diy_Hearing Impaired Doorbell Room Light Hack_train279,"voltage to power either the light switch or the doorbell. In my case I didn't need to do this: to power the doorbell receiver I was able to take 5V from the Arduino supply I made sure the doorbell receiver was under the 200mA limit first and the light switch remote needed 12V anyway which I gave direct from my supply
Reference my rubbish schematic drawing sorry for it being rubbish and:
Solder up the RC low pass filter and the 10 Kohm pull down resistor, then use the Arduino example code AnalogReadSerial to sense a doorbell press remember to connect the grounds together. The serial terminal should read numbers above 50 when the speaker is sounding and should read 0 when the speaker is off.
Solder up the PC123 optocouplers",0
diy_Hearing Impaired Doorbell Room Light Hack_train280,"with a 220 ohm resister to the LED side and direct connection from the output to the light switch remote. Test by adapting the Arduino example code called Blink to use your output pins instead of pin 13. Test to see if you can get the Arduino to switch the lights on and off. This is the bit that I couldn't get to work with the cheaper Chinese light switch but did work with the LightWaveRF switches.
Once you know everything works, mount stuff in your box and use hotmelt to tension the mains cable so if it gets snagged it won't rip out of the terminal blocks.
Step 6: Code
Full Arduino code is attached. You may need to change the pin number for the ones you're using, other than",0

The concept is great. But it is a lot of work. Is there a commercial version? My problem is with buzzers on devices that can't be wired, such as my instantpot. Is there something that can listen and notify me? Would IFTTT or Alexa help?
I shouldn't have to learn electronics and buy equipment just to know that a device has beeped. I'd love to, but are there simpler less expensive options?

diy_Laser cut enclosure with living hinge lid_train298,"Introduction: Laser Cut Enclosure With Living Hinge Lid
I did all my laser cutting at TechShop San Francisco. It was my first attempt and 2 of the 3 boxes that I made worked out but one broke when I tried to bend the lid into place. I tried 3mm MDF, aromatic cedar laser wood from REPLACEDLINK and birch laser wood from the same. The MDF cut and bent perfectly; the cedar burned quite a lot in the cutting more on that later; the birch cut well but it was too thick to bend.
Update I've now improved the design pictured and it works perfectly with birch as well as the other woods. See the final step for the updated design files.
Materials: 3mm laser ply or MDF. 6 x 10mm M2",0
diy_Laser cut enclosure with living hinge lid_train299,"screws and nuts. 1 x wireless sensor node mine is my own design but a friend of mine has written up a very similar one, from which mine is derived 1 x laser cutter, I used a 60W Epilog Helix.
Step 1: Designing the Box
Here's how I built up the design sorry for the lack of screenshots of the working: Set the file to be 24inches x 18inches, which is the bed size of the laser cutter I was working with. In File properties add a 1mm grid. I prefer to work in metric Draw a 6 cm square for the base. I didn't worry about details like the screw slots at this stage. Draw halfcircle for one side and extend down from the ends 1cm to give a",0
diy_Laser cut enclosure with living hinge lid_train300,"flat portion; close the base. Calculate the required length for the top PI 3 2 cm REPLACEDLINK Create a rectangle of that length and 6cm tall. Using the grid snap, draw one copy of the living hinge pattern. Clone the pattern along the length of the lid. Using the path editing tool, refine the shapes, drawing in the pegs and Tslots for the screws. I used a 1mm grid for 90 of the work. For precise pieces like the Tslots, I selected nodes that needed to be off grid and manually entered the coordinates. Using the grid, draw in 2mm circles for the screw holes. For the antenna hole, I used the snap toolbar to turn on snap to cusp and snap to centre and then let the",0
diy_Laser cut enclosure with living hinge lid_train301,"centre of the circle snap tot he end of the line. Then I used the path tool to edit the line to remove overlap. Finally, I added some rounder rectangles to the end piece for air holes and cloned the end piece. I was planning to cut different types of wood that have slightly different thicknesses and I didn't want to have to alter the design for each type so I made the pegs stick out past the end of the slots and curved the ends. On a thinner material, they stick out a bit further but no matter. I made made the pegs slightly wider than the holes by REPLACEDLINK in the design to account for the kerf of the laser beam.
Step 2: The Fun Part: Using",0
diy_Laser cut enclosure with living hinge lid_train302,"the Laser Cutter
I used Inkscape to draw the design but TechShop uses CorelDraw to operate the laser cutter. I found the only way I could get CorelDraw to read an Inkscape file was to export as DXF. I exported as DXF using 1mm units and imported 1:1 using 1mm units in CorelDraw. The design was automatically centred in the Corel document so I moved it to the topleft corner, which is the origin of the laser cutter.
I selected the whole design and confirmed the pen width was hairline, as required, then hit print.
Cutting MDF worked very well with close to the recommended starting settings. However, I found that cutting the cedar ply was problematic. The same settings that cut the MDF only went about 25 through the cedar.",0
diy_Laser cut enclosure with living hinge lid_train303,"Juggling settings, I ended up cutting the cedar 34 times before the cut went through. This lead to a fuzzy cut with a lot of soot. However, the widening of the cut made bending the piece a lot easier later on so if I go back with corrected settings I'll have to alter the design to widen the bending slots!
I cut the birch in one pass using the settings I'd worked out on the cedar but that made a very precise cut and the birch snapped when I tried to make the bend. See the update in step 7 for my improved design that works well with REPLACEDLINK Step 3: Assembling the Box Sides
Follow the instructions in the images to assemble the sides of the box.
Step 4: Install",0
diy_Laser cut enclosure with living hinge lid_train304,"the Lid Feed the antenna through the hole in the lid. Carefully bend the lid down symmetrically to avoid snapping the small pegs on the sides. Hold the lid tightly in place while you install the remaining nuts and screws.
Step 5: Finished
Here's the completed article.
Step 6: What Might Go Wrong
Here's what happened to the birch ply lid with my original design when I tried to make the bend. back to the drawing board! See step 7 for my improved REPLACEDLINK Step 7: Update Improved Design
Since only 2 of 3 of my first batch of boxes survived the bending process, I made a few different modifications to the design and cut them over the weekend. One of the alternate designs worked much better. The lid was very flexible, and",0
diy_Laser cut enclosure with living hinge lid_train305,"I could even bend it round in a circle!
The main change that I made was to reduce the width of the zigzags in the living hinge. Before it was around REPLACEDLINK which was the width of the boards. My new design uses 2mm for the width and reduces the number of central supports to 1 in order to give maximum bend.
I've attached my final Inkscape SVG file to this step.

Reply 8 years ago on Step 1
It was trial and error. I think I shared the plans on the ible though so you can start with that. I think the bands were about the same width as the material was thick. The top of the boxes is very flexible, you can bend it much tighter than the box requires.

I've found that I can save Inkscape files as PDFs on the Mac, or export PDFs from Illustrator, and then print them from Acrobat Reader on a PC, of course, as Epilog's driver doesn't support",0
diy_Laser cut enclosure with living hinge lid_train307,"Mac OS. Inkscape and Draw Plus rasterizes when printing, so it is only useful for raster engraving on Epilog laser cutters.
Regardless of TechShop SF's use of CorelDraw, you don't need to use it. Printing from Acrobat Reader works just fine, as the Epilog driver mimics a printer driver, and can be used from any program it must print a vector image to cut.
I did have problems importing some file formats to CorelDraw, as it appears you have found. Since I primarily work on a Mac, I am happiest just using PDFs for the actual cutting. The same trick works with Inkscape on Windows.

Thanks for the tip. Just to be sure I understand, you are saying that the InkscapePDFAcrobat readerPrint to Epilog path does not rasterize vector lines, so it should work for both vector and raster engraving? But if you just print from Inkscape then it rasterizes before printing so that's no REPLACEDLINK Reply 9 years ago on Step 2
Correct. Printing directly from InkScape rasterizes the image, while exporting to a PDF file does not. Acrobat Reader will then send the properly vector image when printing.

Reply 10 years ago on Introduction
I quite like the aesthetic of the living inge. It's more than strong enough for my purposes. The plywood is only 3mm thick and the whole box would fit on your palm; I don't think cutting a traditional kerf bend, as you describe, at that scale would be easy.

diy_Vacuum Cleaner Subwoofer (Subwoofer com Aspirador de po)_train324,"Introduction: Vacuum Cleaner Subwoofer Subwoofer Com Aspirador De Po
This was an old vacuum cleaner that I had here at REPLACEDLINK could not find the hose and original accessories and the machine was too noisy. It was sometimes used, replacing an air compressor in a drama where I had done the set design.
Was stopped since.
My goal was to turn it into a useful object again. Este era um aspirador de p antigo que eu tinha em casa. No conseguia mais encontrar a mangueira e os acessrios originais e o motor era barulhento demais. Eu o usei algumas vezes, como substituto de um compressor de ar, para inflar um sof, num espetculo em que eu fui cengrafo Frio 36 e Meio.
Desde essa poca ele esteve parado.
Meu objetivo era transformlo em",0
diy_Vacuum Cleaner Subwoofer (Subwoofer com Aspirador de po)_train325,"algo til de novo.
Step 1: Noisy Barulhento
The vacuum seemed to be quite efficient in generating noise. That's what gave me the idea to mount a speaker in the engine block.
The first step was to disassemble the vacuum cleaner, to remove the engine. O aspirador era bastante eficiente no quesito gerao de rudo. Foi isso o que me deu a idia de montar um altofalante no bloco do motor.
O primeiro passo era desmontar o aspirador, para remover o motor.
Step 2: Dismantle the Engine Desmontando O Motor
Once you had removed the engine, now is time to dismantle it. Uma vez que voc retirou o motor, hora de desmontlo.
Step 3: Speaking Falando
I picked this speaker and the capacitor from an old Microsystem. The capacitor is 220F x 16V, in a speaker",0
diy_Vacuum Cleaner Subwoofer (Subwoofer com Aspirador de po)_train326,"of 8, give a Crossover frequency of REPLACEDLINK Using the Calculator of web site: REPLACEDLINK The diameter of speaker is 12cm.
I studied a few ways to insert the speaker in the engine block because it would ensure me less work.
After some testing, I decided to remove the center of the block and put the speaker in this area.
The speaker was a bit loose and had to cut some of EVA rings to secure it better. Eu arranjei este altofalante e o capacitor, que vieram de um velho Microsystem. O capacitor de 220Fx16V, num altofalante de 8, o que nos d uma freqncia Crossover de 90,34Hz, segundo este site aqui: REPLACEDLINK O dimetro do altofalante de 12cm.

Depois de alguns testes, eu decidi remover o centro do bloco para colocar o altofalante nesse espao.
O altofalante ficou com alguma folga e eu cortei uns anis de EVA, para sustentlo melhor.
Step 4: Placing the Capacitor and the Wires Colocando O Capacitor E Os Fios
I put the capacitor in the position of the motor brushes and passed the wires through the center, the position of the motor shaft and secured the support. Coloquei o capacitor no lugar onde ficam as escovas do motor, e passei os fios pelo centro, na posio do eixo do motor. Depois prendi o suporte normalmente.

Great idea! I am used to a wood box, so how will the sound be as the speaker is inserted in a thin metal box? Will the metal be set in motion and give som additional sound? Should there be a thin layer of some sort of dead material like gypsum between the speaker and the metal casing?

I love the concept. I also dig the bilingual text.
My guess is the speaker will sound better if you remove or bypass the capacitor. They are used on midranges and tweeters to block out frequencies that are too LOW for the driver to reproduce a high pass filter.
What you want is a choke, which looks like a big coil of wire, because it",0
diy_Vacuum Cleaner Subwoofer (Subwoofer com Aspirador de po)_train331,"is. It acts as a low pass filter, blocking high frequencies, which will reduce IM distortion essentially low frequencies chopping up higher frequencies.
Time was, one could go to RadioShack and pick up a choke, or a crossover, or even a replacement speaker. Alas, that is no longer the case.
Some surplus houses have crossovers and chokes, Or perhaps you could salvage one from junk a twoway or threeway speaker system.

diy_Wearable Shoe Phone_train345,"Introduction: Wearable Shoe Phone
Any sane geek would think that something as cool as Maxwell Smart's shoephone would be everywhere. You'd think there'd be a company or two selling them online, and the internet would be filled with hobbyists boasting about how proud they are of them.
But it's only ever been done once. That's right, there has only ever been one wearable working shoephone made. And it was made by a guy named Dr Paul GardnerStephen in Adelaide in the world's sexiest country, who hasn't yet fully documented how he did it here. He also made a shoe bluetoothheadset, and thankfully he provided plenty of details. If you're ever looking to make a shoephone that's a little more technical than mine, he's the guy to talk to.
Anyway, due to",0
diy_Wearable Shoe Phone_train346,"the detail he provides, this instructable is largely based on Paul's shoeheadset, REPLACEDLINK with a phone.
Things you'll need:
1. A nicelooking pair of shoes with wooden heels. The heels need to be big enough to fit a box 77x43x17 mm. If they cant, you'll have bits sticking out.
2. A Panasonic GD55. REPLACEDLINK a SERIOUSLY tiny phone.
3. Big feet to put in the big shoes
This is where I got it all:
1. Shoes from a local op shop. I had to go to a few to find something that was good, but I found them eventually 10
2. Phone from Ebay. And it came with a free headset 46
3. REPLACEDLINK well, I've had them for a REPLACEDLINK Tools:
1. Dremel
2. Kitchen knife and fork
3. Strong glue Liquid Nails
4. A tiny little Hex screwdriver
5.",0
diy_Wearable Shoe Phone_train347,"A drill
6. A jigsaw
To make sure your shoe has wooden heels, look at the side of the shoe. You should be able to see a small line between the base of the heel and the wooden bit.
Or, if you're lazy, you can just buy this one on eBay.
Step 1: Opening the Shoe
The rubber base of the heel should be attached by some nails four in my case and some nice strong glue. Slide something thin between the wood and the rubber, and then gradually try to prise it away.
I started with a craft knife, widened the gap until I could use a dinner knife, widened the gap further, then inserted a fork. I used the fork as a crowbar, and finally managed to prise the rubber from the",0
diy_Wearable Shoe Phone_train348,"bottom.
Keep the rubber bit somewhere safe.
Now do the exact same thing with the wooden bit. You should now have three pieces the shoe, the wooden heel, and and rubber heelsole. Put them all aside for a bit.
Step 2: Preparing the Phone
Remove the battery at the back of the phone. There are two screws, bottom left and bottom right, that are both covered by small stickers. Remove the stickers.
Note that the screws require tiny hex REPLACEDLINK If you already have one GREAT otherwise, take the phone to your local hardware store and show them they should be able to find what you want.
Remove the screws, and then remove the phone's front face. Up the top of the circuit board, you might notice another little screw remove it with the",0
diy_Wearable Shoe Phone_train349,"same screwdrivers.
Make sure to set the three screws aside somewhere safe.
Now you'll need to git off the phone's aerial. I just used a saw, and then sanded the stub back so it was almost flush with the phone. A tiny piece should fall out from the centre of the aerial, so it now has a nice hole in it. Solder a wire about 10cm long to the aerial's contact on the circuit board, and feed this wire through the hole where the aerial used to be.
You might like to spraypaint the front of the phone's case black now just make sure you cover the screen with masking tape. I was silly, and waited until the phone was put back together.
Once you've put the phone back together, turn it",0
diy_Wearable Shoe Phone_train350,"on and make sure you're getting reception and make sure you have a SIM card in the phone.
The phone is now ready to be put inside the shoe.
Step 3: Making a Hole in the Shoe
Mark the area in the wooden heel the needs to be cut out to fit the phone. Make sure you have some way of charging the phone up. Drill big holes at the corners, and use a Jigsaw to cut yourself a hole.
Make sure the phone fits in the hole. Now you can glue and or nail the wooden heel back onto the shoe.
Now it's time for you to do a bit of thinking:
Is your shoe going to be worn anywhere besides nice carpeted areas? If so, you'll want the phone to be completely",0
diy_Wearable Shoe Phone_train351,"covered by rubber, and you'll need to work out how you'll see the phone's screen etc. I'd recommend making a removable flap in the rubber, but still make sure you have easy access to the 'answer' and 'hang up' buttons at all time.
If, like me, your shoephone is more for show, and doesn't need to be taken over rough terrain, just cut a hole in the rubber sole a little bit smaller than the phone just big enough to allow access to the buttons and the screen. I used a simple craftknife for this.
Step 4: Putting the Phone in the Shoe
This is when I finally spraypainted the phone, after putting it back together. Now put a little bit of hot glue underneath the phone, and put it in",0
diy_Wearable Shoe Phone_train352,"place inside the shoe.
Then all you need to do is reattach the rubber heel. I used a combination of nails and liquid nails a strong all purpose slowdrying glue.
Finally, clamp everything down, and go to sleep. When you wake up, it'll be good. If you don't wait, it'll fall apart.
Step 5: Final Notes
Just so everyone knows, I have no experience with anything like this, besides the NESBlinky on this site, and my other instructable. I've never disassembled shoes, or anything like that.
I'm probably doing things the silly way if you can think of a better way to do things like this, by all means try it out. And tell me I'd love to improve my design.
I'd also like to say that if you're not careful, you could easily",0
diy_Wearable Shoe Phone_train353,"ruin the phone or the shoes. So be careful.
Finally, if anyone has any crazy ideas, please tell me. I'm considering turning the left shoe into an mp3 player, but I'm not sure how silly I'd look with a cable running from my shoe to my REPLACEDLINK Stay tuned or subscribe to me and wait for ShoePhone REPLACEDLINK where the phone will be completely concealed, and buttons will have to be moved. It'll be a lot more complicated, but the result will be six times better :

clean_data_prose_299.txt_train357,"LOST HIS NAME. ON the second day of June, 186, a young Norseman, Halfdan Bjerk
by name, landed on the pier at Castle Garden. He passed through the
straight and narrow gate where he was asked his name, birthplace, and
how much money he had,at which he grew very much frightened. And your destination?demanded the grufflooking functionary at the
desk. America, said the youth, and touched his hat politely. Do you think I have time for joking? roared the official, with an
oath. The Norseman ran his hand through his hair, smiled his timidly
conciliatory smile, and tried his best to look brave; but his hand
trembled and his heart thumped away at an alarmingly quickened tempo. Put him down for Nebraska! cried a stout redcheeked individual
inwrapped in the mingled fumes of tobacco and whisky",0
clean_data_prose_299.txt_train358,"whose function it
was to open and shut the gate. There ain't many as go to Nebraska. All right, Nebraska. The gate swung open and the pressure from behind urged the timid
traveler on, while an extra push from the gatekeeper sent him flying in
the direction of a board fence, where he sat down and tried to realize
that he was now in the land of liberty. Halfdan Bjerk was a tall, slenderlimbed youth of very delicate frame;
he had a pair of wonderfully candid, unreflecting blue eyes, a smooth,
clear, beardless face, and soft, wavy light hair, which was pushed back
from his forehead without parting. His mouth and chin were well cut, but
their lines were, perhaps, rather weak for a man. When in repose, the
ensemble of his features was exceedingly pleasing and",0
clean_data_prose_299.txt_train359,"somehow reminded
one of Correggio's St. John. He had left his native land because he was
an ardent republican and was abstractly convinced that man, generically
and individually, lives more happily in a republic than in a monarchy.
He had anticipated with keen pleasure the large, freely breathing life
he was to lead in a land where every man was his neighbor's brother,
where no senseless traditions kept a jealous watch over obsolete
systems and shrines, and no chilling prejudice blighted the spontaneous
blossoming of the soul. Halfdan was an only child. His father, a poor government official, had
died during his infancy, and his mother had given music lessons, and
kept boarders, in order to gain the means to give her son what",0

diy_Bluetooth Maze_train366,"Introduction: Bluetooth Maze
Everybody knows it and played it even once. The maze where you have to get to the end without falling down. At first there was the physical game to train you coordination, but then when Iphone and co got on the market it was one of the first apps on the marktet. My idea was to make the bridge between digital and physical world and design a physical game thats controlled via bluetooth from the smartphone.
Step 1: Hard software
before i thought about the design, the first step was to think about the realisation.
for the technical part you will need:
hardware:
1x arduino Minini Pro first i used the UNO because its easyer to programm it
1x Bluetooth modul HC6 think it is also working with the HC5
2x polysterol 1401401mm",0
diy_Bluetooth Maze_train367,"or any other 1mm slippery material
2x 9g mini servo
1x battery or akku to power an arduino some screws to fix the servos
software: Arduino Idle
App Inventor 2 account
Step 2: Design and Material
i choose the classical design istead of a circled or polygonal. you can scale the project in the size you want but my 3d printer has a printing area of 140 x140 millimeters so thats the boundary of my mazegame.
for the case you will need:
4x 30mm x 140mm wood.
4x 5x11x5 bearings REPLACEDLINK Lot685ZZ685ZZ5x11x5mmThinWallDeepGrooveBallBearingMiniBallBearing REPLACEDLINK hotglue optional plastic glue!!!
3d printing parts
Step 3: App Inventor 2
there are many ways to programm the app but i choose app inventor 2 because it makes the bluetooth connection very easy. REPLACEDLINK the principle is to connect to the bluetooth and then send 4",0
diy_Bluetooth Maze_train368,"different values to the arduino.
Step 4: Arduino
the circuit diagramm is very easy and it works fine.
the code is also not that bad.
Attachments
Step 5: Build
first thing is to 3d print the stl files print the pdf and cut the holes out of the polysterol
put the the parts together like in the picture description glue the wooden frame together after testing the axes fix glue the bootom to the wooden frame optional you can color the maze i sprayed mine light grey

In The Great Man of the Provinces in Paris some likenesses were imagined: Jules Janin in Etienne Lousteau, Armand Carrel in Michel Chrestien, and, possibly, Berryer in Daniel d'Arthez. But in the present volume, Beatrix, he used the characteristics of certain persons, which were recognized and admitted at the time of publication. Mademoiselle des Touches Camille Maupin is George Sand in character, and the personal description of her, though applied by some to the famous Mademoiselle Georges, is easily recognized from Couture's drawing.

REPLACEDLINK BEATRIX I. A BRETON TOWN AND MANSION France, especially in Brittany, still possesses certain towns completely
outside of the movement which gives to the nineteenth century its
peculiar characteristics. For lack of quick and regular communication
with Paris, scarcely connected by wretched roads with the
subprefecture, or the chief city of their own province, these towns

they continue",0

and of still more ancient times in the towns of Brittany. Most of these
towns have fallen from states of splendor never mentioned by historians,

history of manners and customs. The tradition of this splendor still

However, now I'm a little frustrated. Your advertisement says that you can export a product preview as a process, save it under WAREHOUSE and copy it to an SD card and then display it on an external presentation device. Now I have a device GOMER SV7327 which the manufacturer promises to play the following process formats .PRC; .CRV; DATE 2 5 is also a sample process in the .dat format on the internal memory.",0

Dr. Kendra Gagnon also contributed to this manual.
Modifications include: A PVC",0
diy_Jeep Modification - Acceleration With a Button_train439,"exoskeleton backed with pool noodles for cushioning. A kickboard to the back of the seat to increase back support for the child OR a harness for the child. Converting the acceleration mechanism from a pedal to a button placed on the steering wheel. Adding a kill switch to the back of the vehicle.
Step 1: Gathering Parts and Supplies
Below are the lists of all the parts required for the modification. Most of these will be found in hardware stores such as Home Depot or Lowes, unless otherwise noted. The electronics have hyperlinks directed to the product pages for order. The internal modifications require skills in soldering and wiring.

Step 2: Assembling the Vehicle
IMPORTANT NOTE: Do not assemble the vehicle according to the instruction manual given with the car; instead, use these instructions. The instruction manual given with the car includes steps that inhibit this modification and cannot be undone. Flip the vehicle over, and remove the rear axle located underneath the vehicle on the left side of",0
diy_Jeep Modification - Acceleration With a Button_train441,"the vehicle's shell. For reference, consult image 1. Attach the rear axle. First, remove the nut and bolt from the rear stabilizer bars. Then, insert the rear axle through the gearboxs stabilizer bars and suspension modules. Align the holes in the axle with the holes in the rear stabilizer bars, and reinsert the nut and bolt to secure the rear axle. If these steps are completed correctly, the rear axle should be locked into place. For reference, consult image 2. Insert the wheels rear wheels onto the rear axle so that the gear side of the wheels faces toward the inside of the vehicle. Place the large washers included with the vehicle on the rear axle. Secure the wheel by inserting the pin into the hole in the",0
diy_Jeep Modification - Acceleration With a Button_train442,"axle and bending the pin using needle nose pliers. Attach decorative hubcap to wheels by aligning the tabs with the slits in the wheel. For reference, consult image 3. First, slide the front axle into the steering column so that the bar sinks into the car and the plates for the bolts align with the holes on the vehicle. Secure the axle using the screws provided. Place the large washer onto the shaft that extends to the front of the vehicle from the steering column. Secure this shaft by inserting the pin and bending the pin using needle nose pliers. For reference, consult image 4. Place the front wheels onto the front axle, ensuring that the side of the wheel that the hubcap would fit on faces outward.",0
diy_Jeep Modification - Acceleration With a Button_train443,"Place the large washers onto the axle. Secure the wheel by inserting the pin and bending the pin using needle nose pliers. Attach the decorative hubcap to the wheels. For reference, consult image 5
Step 3: Assembling the PVC Structure
IMPORTANT NOTE: There are two options to modify the seat: a kickboard or a harness. Please read through both options, and then decide which option suits the child the best. Also, keep in mind that many parts are difficult to remove once they have been secured. Cut out the PVC or CPVC according to the sizes listed below using a PVC cutter. Be as precise as possible. 4 pieces of 5 inch PVC 4 pieces of 7 inch PVC 2 pieces of 4 inch PVC 2 pieces of 3 inch",0
diy_Jeep Modification - Acceleration With a Button_train444,"PVC 4 pieces of 2 inch CPVC
Option 1: Boogie Board
Drill 4 holes in a rectangle into the boogie board, and use zip ties through these holes to secure the boogie board against the PVC exoskeleton. Consult image 4.
Option 2: Harness
Place a pool noodle on both the top and bottom PVC crossbar at the back of the truck. Zip tie these pool noodles into place. Secure the harness by wrapping the harness bands around the pool noodles or using velcro. Consult image 5.
Step 4: Wiring the Kill Switch Open the vehicles hood to uncover all of the electronics. Cut the wire between the positive battery terminal and the breaker. Cut about one inch from the spade connector that attaches to the battery lead. Strip about of insulation off of",0
diy_Jeep Modification - Acceleration With a Button_train445,"each side of the wire that was just cut. Prepare a 50inch wire harness that has ring lugs on one end and is stripped bare on the other end. Cut a 50inch long wire. On one side of the wire, strip off about of insulation, and crimp on a ring terminal ring lug. On the other side of the wire, strip off about of insulation, and leave it bare. For reference, consult image 1. Splice the wire that was cut in step 2 with the wire harness prepared in step 3. Place one end of the stripped side of the wire harness into one side of a butt splice, and place one end of the wire cut near the battery into the other side of the butt splice.",0
diy_Jeep Modification - Acceleration With a Button_train446,"Using a crimper, crimp the butt splice. Use a heat gun to heat shrink the butt splice. Repeat these steps with the other two ends of the wires. Alternatively, use wire nuts instead of butt splices to splice the wires, or solder the wires together. NOTE: The color of the wire does not matter, because it is going to a kill switch, in which the orientation of the positive negative wires does not matter. For reference, consult image 2 Guide the wire harness through the hole that is near the battery, as shown in image 3. Direct the wire harness underneath the left wheel housing and make sure to tape the wires so that they do not get caught in the wheels of the car, as shown in",0
diy_Jeep Modification - Acceleration With a Button_train447,"image 4. Mount the kill switch. Drill a 15 32 hole into the bottom left corner of the backside of the truck. Fit the kill switch through the drilled hole so that the threaded portion of the switch fully fits through. Screw the nut onto the switch. After the switch is mounted, secure the ring lugs onto the kill switch by screwing them onto the back ends. If the switch has ON and OFF labels, make sure to align the OFF position to be downwards. For reference, consult image 5.
Step 5: Wiring the Button First, locate the wires that will be cut for this modification. Find the white plug located underneath the dashboard, and unplug it. Note the orientation of the plug blue wire on top, orange wire",0
diy_Jeep Modification - Acceleration With a Button_train448,"on bottom. Also, find the bundle of wires that originates from the pedal and cut both of the ground brown wires that run to from the pedal. For reference, consult image 1. Strip off about of insulation from the ground wire that runs from the white plug, and strip off about of insulation from the ground wire that is in a bundle with a blue and red wire. For reference, consult image 2. Discard the bundle of wires running to from the pedal; those will no longer be needed for this modification. Prepare a 32inch wire harness that has spade connectors on one end and is stripped bare on the other end. Cut a 32inch long wire. On one side of the wire, strip off about of insulation,",0
diy_Jeep Modification - Acceleration With a Button_train449,"and crimp on a spade connector. On the other side of the wire, strip off about of insulation, and leave it bare. For reference, consult image 3. Splice the two ground wires that were cut in step 1 with the wire harness prepared in step 2. Place one end of the stripped side of the wire harness into one side of a butt splice, and place one end of the ground wire cut into the other side of the butt splice. Using a crimper, crimp the butt splice. Use a heat gun to heat shrink the butt splice. Repeat these steps with the other two ends of the wires. Alternatively, use wire nuts instead of butt splices to splice the wires, or solder the wires together. To mount",0
diy_Jeep Modification - Acceleration With a Button_train450,"the button onto the steering wheel, guide the wire harness through one of the two large holes above the dashboard where the windshield would have been placed. Assemble the button and mount it onto the steering wheel. We used a lasercut mount. Attach the spade connectors to the button. One wire should be attached to the terminal on the bottom of the limit switch, and one wire should be attached to the terminal on the side of the limit switch. You may have to exchange the wires between these two terminals for the button to work. Zip tie the wires around the steering wheel column. For reference, consult image 4.
Step 6: Operating the Jeep
To sync the remote control with the car: Turn off the vehicle. Press and hold",0
diy_Jeep Modification - Acceleration With a Button_train451,"the button at the top of the remote control until the light on the remote flashes. Turn on the vehicle.
To use the remote control: To change the speed, press the S button. The lights indicate the current speed level of the car. To use the emergency brake park feature, press the P button. To deactivate the brake park, press the P button again. NOTE: The directional controls on the remote control override the directional controls on the vehicle.
To charge the vehicle: The charging port is located under the power button and radio on the dashboard. A typical charge takes 812 hours, and do not charge for more than 20 hours. Make sure to turn off the car while charging.
Step 7: Troubleshooting
If your child is too large, try one",0
diy_Jeep Modification - Acceleration With a Button_train452,"of the following: Place cushions on the seat to elevate them and allow more vertical leg room. Remove the plastic seat and put a cushion on the bottom for more lateral space Modify the PVC exoskeleton to allow your child to fit into their seat better. There is no one right way to improve your child's fit in the car be creative!
If the Jeep wont move: Ensure the kill switch and power button are set to the ON position, the shifter is not in the neutral position, and the emergency brake on the remote control is off. Make sure that the wires are plugged into the button, and check under the hood for any loose wires.

Hi
We got a 12v Jeep for our granddaughter. Worked fine and stored in garage till she got bigger. Pulled it our today and when I turn on the key the horn just keep honking nonstop. Everything else works. If I press a button on the radio the horn will stop, but a second or 2 after I release it the horn starts beeping again. Any ideas what's wrong?

most favorable one; still, it is not without its picturesque and even
brilliant side. Nothing could well resemble less a typical English
street than the interminable avenue, rich in incongruities, through
which our two travelers advancedlooking out on each side of them

heterogeneous architecture, the huge white marble facades glittering

diy_Mini oscilloscope kit (part 1)_train473,"Introduction: Mini Oscilloscope Kit part 1
Where to start is always the problem , it's easier to plan an electronic device then write about it.
OK, lets start with the blueprint usually before I start a new project I make some scribbles to keep in mind what I'm planning to do, this blueprints are not very exactly my products grow when I make them.
This is the plan. small kit for an DSO I will use one from REPLACEDLINK still waiting for delivery battery powered, I have a LiIon Battery laying around I bought them very cheap at MediaMarkt I want to build another case that fits in size and look another one I build for an electronic load. The load was my first instcrutable I found here and build. It",0
diy_Mini oscilloscope kit (part 1)_train474,"is from wigman27 and very useful. the great electronic load I posted here also the pictures of my build with the wood REPLACEDLINK want to use it also as powersource for different voltages 3,3V 5V 12V use my own Power Switch with LED my first instructable I wrote switch with LED cheap is possible, so most of the parts are leftover from other projects
Step 1: Ordering the DSO
I order it at REPLACEDLINK a Chinese shopping site I like it more then the other shops like aliexpress. The quality until now for all the kit's I order here was great and even they didn't include any instructions I was always able to build the Kits.
I also bought some switches and LED's and prototype PCB there.
They have more funny thinks",0
diy_Mini oscilloscope kit (part 1)_train475,"there for very reasonable price.
Still waiting for the DSO, and some other Parts for nice projects, I'm running out of ATMEL 328P the Arduino Chip
Step 2: Prepare the Parts
I already have some parts laying around. This is what I used them for. LiIon Battery 3,7V 6000mAh USB Charger StepUP Converter to get 12V 7805 TO220 Big One it is a linear voltage regulator with fixed voltage for the 5V rail LM317 TO92 Small One it is a linear voltage regulator with variable volatge for the 3,3V rail Switch and 5mm LED for the power Button see my other instruction pin header 10 pins I will use this in the front panel to get out the voltage rails to a prototype board
Step 3: Why I Want to Build This",0
diy_Mini oscilloscope kit (part 1)_train476,"Like This
1 . I have a DSO but want a small one that is battery powered
2. Of course there are a lot of pockets DSO they are about 100 but hey it is no fun to buy them finished
3. I like wood cases, hey do you ever see a DSO in a wood case?
4. I like the size and the look of my Case for the electronic load, so I want more in labor stuff in those cases you can see I also modified the electronic load with a LiIon Battery.
5. It's fun to make thinks
This pictures I just show you the way it will go and my messy workplace, it is not many place here but hey I can do my hobby in living rooms.
Step 4: What",0
diy_Mini oscilloscope kit (part 1)_train477,"Will Be Next
After I received the Kit I will give you a full review and a lot of pictures while assembling the Kit and making the case with easy tools, no fancy Laser Cutter or 3D Printers REPLACEDLINK just with Glue, Knife, REPLACEDLINK Those both pictures show some old projects. I really like wooden REPLACEDLINK ;
Give me a Big Thumbs up and have fun with my instructions story's ideas
See you next REPLACEDLINK Step 5: April 1
this is not an April Scherz that is what we say for April first in German
I just get my 4mm Plywood today so I can start to build the case, normally I just start to cut and glue and then see what I need next. I know this is not the best way",0
diy_Mini oscilloscope kit (part 1)_train478,"to build a case but hey it works for me.
But this time I want to share my build with you so I started to think which parts I need and so I draw them in PowerPoint.
Maybe now you will ask.Powerpoint for CAD! Are you sure?
Yes you hear it right for simple Design I use Powerpoint, for me it is precise enough and work well and my plywood I have is at the Size of one DinA4 page sp everything fit perfect. Hey try also some CAD software but it is total overkill for this.
I think tomorrow I can show more of the process to build the REPLACEDLINK are the files for you if you want to use, maybe when I have enough time I will copy the Parts",0
diy_Mini oscilloscope kit (part 1)_train479,"to a CAD software so it is more useful for you.
Step 6: Cut the Parts From 4mm Plywood
I just lay the printout on the plywood, so it was more easy to cut them out, I'm using a cutter knife to cut it out so no special saw needed. Of course when you can use a Laser Cutter it would be much better, but hey who has a Laser cutter at home.
I also cut some support parts just about 10mm x 10mm where I use to make the box more stable.
Step 7: Glue It Together
On the Bottom I glued the left and right wall just in 90 so this parts will be fixed I also added to first 4 support parts, I think the Front I will make screw",0
diy_Mini oscilloscope kit (part 1)_train480,"able so it can be removed maybe also the back, but not sure yet.
I used some heavy boxes to hold the parts together while the glue dry's, I used Uhu Hart but the white wood glue should also work.
Now it is really time that the electronic parts arrive.
Step 8: Some More Parts and Ideas
I just order a few of this, I already have some of the stepup and stepdown converters but they don't have any current protection, this module sound good, so I think is better then a LM317 for regulate the voltage.
For about 3,60 including sending it sound pretty cheap.
It won't be only a DSO it will be a mobile electronic something something bench power dso REPLACEDLINK the only disappointing think is that it take so long",0
diy_Mini oscilloscope kit (part 1)_train481,"to order from china, here in Germany we are really spoiled allmost everything else I order at Internet shops is there almost the next day.

tale of victorious faith, first appeared some years ago as a Christmas
Annual. Another, Elissa, is an attempt, difficult enough owing to the
scantiness of the material left to us by time, to recreate the life of
the ancient Phoenician Zimbabwe, whose ruins still stand in Rhodesia,
and, with the addition of the necessary love story, to suggest
circumstances such as might have brought about or accompanied its fall
at the hands of the surrounding savage tribes. The third, Black Heart
and White Heart, is a story of the courtship, trials and final union of
a pair of Zulu lovers in",0

lost in mystery as those of Zimbabwe in South Central Africa. Who built
them? What purpose did they serve? These are questions that must have
perplexed many generations, and many different races of men. The researches of Mr. Wilmot prove to us indeed that in the Middle Ages
Zimbabwe or Zimboe was the seat of a barbarous empire, whose ruler was
named the Emperor of Monomotapa, also that for some years the Jesuits
ministered in a Christian church built beneath the shadow of its ancient
towers. But of the original purpose of those towers,",0
clean_data_prose_2855.txt_train510,"and of the
race that reared them, the inhabitants of mediaeval Monomotapa, it is
probable, knew less even than we know today. The labours and skilled
observation of the late Mr. Theodore Bent, whose death is so great
a loss to all interested in such matters, have shown almost beyond
question that Zimbabwe was once an inland Phoenician city, or at the
least a city whose inhabitants were of a race which practised Phoenician
customs and worshipped the Phoenician deities. Beyond this all is
conjecture. How it happened that a trading town, protected by vast
fortifications and adorned with temples dedicated to the worship of the
gods of the Sidoniansor rather trading towns, for Zimbabwe is only one
of a group of ruinswere built by civilised men in the heart of Africa

btc_f9422d6721becbb80d2ceba1a07e8a9d_train515,"Bitcoin inventor Dr. Craig Wright is busy educating the worldnot only about Bitcoin though. In the past months, Dr. Wright has been lecturing on philosophy in depth.
There already are 11 philosophy classes by Dr. Wright recorded so far, which are published on the Theory of Bitcoin YouTube channel: Introductory and Foundational Lesson Plato Apology and Crito Plato Republic Book I II Aristotle Nicomachean Ethics Aristotle Politics Aristotle Metaphysics Aristotle Athenian Constitution Aeschylus Prometheus Bound Aeschylus Agamemnon, Choephoroe and Eumenides Lucretius On the nature of things Additional Content Revolutionary America the Federalist Number 10
Craig Wright is into educationand that influenced Bitcoin, too!
The philosophy course is part of a greater effort from Dr. Wright to spread liberal education. On his personal website, Dr. Wright describes the philosophy course as follows:
In",0
btc_f9422d6721becbb80d2ceba1a07e8a9d_train516,"this course, we will delve into the most fundamental aspects of Western philosophy and the Western canon. Then, where this has developed into a level of understanding around the Enlightenment canon and the birth of rational thought, we will extend the studies and time onto alternative paths, including some aspects of Eastern philosophy.
Dr. Wright recently finished his dissertation for his Master of Arts in Education at Brunel University in London. We have discussed education and the West with Dr. Wright before, but this time, he seems to be going much deeper. As can be read in the syllabus for the philosophy course, more topics are to be lectured soon:
Why wide range education mattered and still matters for Bitcoin
How come the inventor of Bitcoin is spending his time lecturing",0
btc_f9422d6721becbb80d2ceba1a07e8a9d_train517,"on philosophy, though? Bitcoin is not just code and cryptography. In fact, it is safe to say that code and cryptography are the boring parts of Bitcoin.
As stated by the Bitcoin white paper, Bitcoin is a peertopeer electronic cash system. We have discussed the cash quality of Bitcoin before, as well as how Dr. Wright solved the problems with electronic cash.
In his article Solving DoubleSpending, Dr. Wright describes the failures of previous electronic cash systems, such as insufficient traceability and the need for trusted third parties or anonymous observers. It shows that with Bitcoin, Dr. Wright not only solved these problems by creating a free marketdriven incentive system, but he had to have a wide educational background to identify these obstacles first.
Furthermore, there were legal implications that had",0
btc_f9422d6721becbb80d2ceba1a07e8a9d_train518,"to be considered before creating Bitcoin. Dr. Wright states in Solving DoubleSpending:
The reason that Bitcoin does not require a central operator is that the issue of tokens was completed at the launch of the product, and the distribution is automated. The requirements for maintaining the system are defined and set in stone. In other words, the protocol does not change. As the protocol does not change, and the incentive system is defined to operate without interaction, the system becomes the first system developed to continue operating without the continuous interaction of a third party.
The issuance of the tokens was completed at launch, precisely by having Bitcoin bound under contract. Whoever pays too much attention to Bitcoin as solely code and cryptography misses all the above. Satoshi Nakamoto delivered",0
btc_f9422d6721becbb80d2ceba1a07e8a9d_train519,"an electronic cash system on an academic level.
How to join Dr. Craig Wrights philosophy course?
It probably is a onceinalifetime chance to get taught philosophy by the inventor of Bitcoin. Usually, philosophy is lectured on by university professors who have not created an electronic cash system that is used worldwide today. Interesting, isnt it?
The philosophy course is organized by the MetaNet ICU and requires full membership and identification of the participants. In order to participate, it is best to reach out to Brendan Lee or Joel Dalais.
The video sessions of the course are going to be uploaded to the MetaNet ICU YouTube channel afterward, but live participation is more rewarding for sure. Personally, I will be attending the course and will cover the lecture material and Dr. Wrights lectures",0
btc_f9422d6721becbb80d2ceba1a07e8a9d_train520,"in my upcoming articles as well.
Participants will be continuously tested throughout the lectures and will be able to join the course via Zoom. Active discussion is appreciated.

Confused ideas of the vulgar on the subject. A miracle in the sense of a contravention of natural laws an absurdity. In the sense of an event, whose cause is unknown,

Bitcoin: Heres the case for an early Christmas in October for BTC holders
Is optimism around Bitcoin BTC and its holders seeing a solid foundation despite the daunting bear? Well, it certainly looks like the case. The overall supply on exchanges has dropped to extreme lows, as per data from Santiment. Here, its worth noting that the drop came at a time of widemarket selloffs.
Heres AMBCryptos Price Prediction for Bitcoin BTC for 202324
Smiling through the pain
Bitcoin BTC, the worlds largest crypto, despite the struggle, continued to witness more gains above the 19,000level. At the time of writing, BTC was trading around the REPLACEDLINK mark after flashing a 3 hike on the price charts. Simply put, it was all green for BTC, both on the price and supply front.
In fact,",0
btc_1b399830ac065fb59def8715bc37aaa2_train561,"BTCs supply on exchanges fell to another four year low, thereby reducing further marketwide selloff risks.
The chart attached herein can be observed to assess this improving scenario. BTC continued to see its supply move away from exchanges as traders showed further signs of being content with their current holdings.
It was in light of the aforementioned finding that Santiment added,
With less than 9 of BTC on exchanges for the first time since 2018, it is a good bode of confidence for bulls.
This indeed would support bullish momentum for the king coin and its respective holders. Additionally, money leaving cryptocurrency exchanges also seemed to have deteriorated. According to data from Bloomberg, money flowing out of crypto exchangetraded funds slowed down by 97 in Q3 compared to Q2.
How were holders feeling",0
btc_1b399830ac065fb59def8715bc37aaa2_train562,"about it, you ask?
Well, most Bitcoin investors remained unaffected by the consequences of the economic outlook and bet big on the future rally of BTC. Yes, the pace did take a hit, but the aim remained the same.
Also, according to Glassnode, BTC holders remained within the range of 800 million to 1 billion to rise even higher. But again, they waited for the right triggers.
Drop your vote HERE
Needless to say, on the back of every possible scenario being discussed, cryptoTwitter emerged to be more vocal than ever.
For instance, one proponent sought to look at the development with a macrolevel lens. The user tweeted,
October has typically seen the thirdhighest average monthly returns, behind April and November. Notably, the worst month for BTC has historically been September.
Another popular cryptocurrency analyst",0
btc_1b399830ac065fb59def8715bc37aaa2_train563,"revealed that the flagship cryptocurrency could easily get to the 25,000mark this month based on historical returns.
Having said that, one shouldnt forget about the looming bear within the cryptomarket. Especially since the Fear and Greed Index was flashing EXTREME FEAR at press time.",0

The Orange Pill Diaries, Part One
Like many women in Bitcoin, I was first introduced to it by my partner. He had been a banker, and spoke eloquently and knowledgeably about money. When he first told me about it in 2016 the thing that shocked me the most was how ignorant about money I was back then. He asked me if I knew what the gold standard was to my embarrassment, I had only the vaguest of ideas.
We both went on quite the learning journey together, he leading the way. We both did an online course, the first of its kind, about digital currencies and he went on to do a Masters from",0
btc_1c1e80109e5c6e1a8fb3b413f61ed90f_train573,"the same university, Nicosia in Cyprus.
My first Bitcoin conference was an experience. Of the hundred and fifty odd participants, I was one of only three women and I joked with the other two about how this was the only event we had ever attended where there was no queue at the womens bathroom. But there was no denying it the atmosphere at that conference was electric. We were fizzing with an irrepressible excitement. We were onto something big and we knew it.
My learning when it comes to Bitcoin has never stopped and I look back at those early days with a fond nostalgia. The more I learned, the further reaching the changes I made. Soon enough I had changed my diet, my lifestyle, my approach to religion, family,",0

I guess once you have seen how important a discovery Bitcoin is, it could be argued that there is something of a moral imperative to tell the people who you care about. Ive been doing my best to make Bitcoin the subject of conversation amongst my family and my friends. Of course and sadly the success of this attempt is highly correlated to the price of Bitcoin at the time. But even taking the highs and the low in dollars into account it still surprises me how slow Bitcoin is, how hesitant most people are.
The series of stories which I have written as the Orange Pill Diaries are all true, and theyre about my varied attempts to introduce people I know and care about to Bitcoin. Im hoping",0
btc_1c1e80109e5c6e1a8fb3b413f61ed90f_train575,"that in the telling of my successes and failures there might be some common themes that Bitcoiners might be able to recognise, build upon or use.
These stories are all about people I know, friends or family. This first installment is about my friend Isobel, who owns a small trail riding business on the west coast of Portugal.
Ive got something Id like to show you, is what she said. I hesitated. I was sweat streaked and dusty. There was mud in my hair and blood under my nails from where I had clung on coming down a steep bank. I smelled strongly of horse. What I wanted was a long, cool shower with plenty of soap and shampoo in the heat of the Portuguese evening.
But when Isobel tells me",0
btc_1c1e80109e5c6e1a8fb3b413f61ed90f_train576,"she has something to show me, its pretty much always something special. Once it was a German cavalry saddle from the second World War which someone had unearthed from someones grandfathers attic and given to her as a gift. She had restored it with oil and the love true horsemen and women bestow on good equipment. Another time it was a pair of three year old Lusitano colts standing in the dusk, down through a wood and across a little stream. They were trusting, curious, blinking in the light from my phone. They rifled gently through our pockets for treats, explored our hair and boots with their muzzles and submitted to being petted like puppies.
So I followed her into the cool of her hallway, expecting her to lead",0
btc_1c1e80109e5c6e1a8fb3b413f61ed90f_train577,"me further into her house. Instead she fumbled under a pile of horse blankets and pulled out a cracked Ikea picture frame. Inside it, a five euro note. I found this, she said. I was out on a ride through the dunes and I saw it in the heather! So I jumped off and grabbed it. I looked at her in some confusion. Well, its not mine, I replied.
No well, I mean, I know. To my great surprise I saw that she had tears in her eyes. I know Isobel as a cheerful, sensible businesswomen, one of the best horsewomen I know and I know very many, on this continent and beyond. Nothing phases her.
Seeing her on the verge of tears was unthinkable and I was momentarily lost",0
btc_1c1e80109e5c6e1a8fb3b413f61ed90f_train578,"for words. I just wanted to thank you again for coming. she says.
With COVID19, times have been hard. Its not like horses stop eating, or dont need vets, or dont need the blacksmith once in a while, just because travel restrictions are in place and no tourists are here. Feed has gone up in price, shoeing too and no clients have been coming. When I found this five euro note I kept it for if I really get to a time again when I have nothing on my bank balance. At least Ill be able to buy bread for my kids for the next day. So thank you for coming. Im so glad youve never stopped traveling, even in all the restrictions and that you have come to",0
btc_1c1e80109e5c6e1a8fb3b413f61ed90f_train579,"ride with me again.
I didnt know what to say. Riding with her is a real highlight of every visit to the area but it had stupidly never occurred to me just how tight for money she must have been with so few clients, or how valuable my custom was.
Brightening, she told me how, to save on blacksmiths bills, she has taught herself how to trim her horses feet and is changing her routes so they only need to take the soft sand paths through the dunes. Its sixty five euros per horse per eight weeks now, she added. I have seven horses. That adds up very fast. This way, I keep their feet trimmed myself and none of them need shoes. She was cheerful again. I reached out",0
btc_1c1e80109e5c6e1a8fb3b413f61ed90f_train580,"to stroke the pretty white mare who had just taken me through the sand dunes, a light hearted adventure of walking and chatting combined with wild gallops down the narrow, twisting paths, emerging suddenly at breakneck speed onto cliff tops, with the turquoise Atlantic below. Wed talked about horses and our respective children and wed come back a little giddy from the galloping and the ozone rich air.
Id visited some months before, and I remembered when this horse was new. Almost all of Isobels horses are rescue horses. When she came this mare was afraid of her own shadow. If you raised a hand in her direction she flinched fearfully away, expecting a blow. Now, munching calmly on her feed, she turned contentedly towards me and rested her",0
btc_1c1e80109e5c6e1a8fb3b413f61ed90f_train581,"head briefly against my shoulder. I reached in my pocket for the cash I had put there, to pay for the ride I had just taken. Id slipped in a little extra but still, it didnt feel quite right, paying Isobel in euros. Someone whose work and skill I respected so much should be paid in well, better money. I gave it to her and she took it with a smile and more thanks.
I weighed my options carefully, trying to gauge her reaction. I knew if I offered her any financial help she wouldnt accept it, would be offended, even, and that it may sour a friendship which even in its very early days I recognized as a valuable one. I thought quickly through the pros and cons",0
btc_1c1e80109e5c6e1a8fb3b413f61ed90f_train582,"and then took the plunge. Do you remember how I told you about Bitcoin, Isobel? I asked her. She nodded. Well, would you maybe have time later in the week so I can explain it more? I think it might be a good way for you to be able to plan for the future.
My kids love a good swimming pool. I had made sure that the villa I had rented for our trip had one and a couple of days later I was lying beside it watching them plunge in, get out and plunge in again. Half my attention was on my book, which I wish I could tell you was something weighty on Bitcoin but was in fact an engaging novel about a penguin and mafia intrigues.",0
btc_1c1e80109e5c6e1a8fb3b413f61ed90f_train583,"I heard a bicycle on the gravel of the driveway and looked up to see Isobel peeking inquiringly around the hedge. Have you got time now? she asked. I brought my laptop.
We had spoken a bit about Bitcoin before. She knew I had an interest in it and was happy to talk about it. She also knew that I didnt want to give her financial advice on her personal situation but that I had made it very clear that if she had questions Id be more than happy to help.

btc_1c1e80109e5c6e1a8fb3b413f61ed90f_train584,"have seen the revolution. Knowing Isobels financial situation, I started with the gains. I showed her a chart of Bitcoins price development over the years and I explained how, even though there are often dips, the dips have never gone to zero. I repeated the well known mantra: No one who has invested in Bitcoin for four years and not sold has ever lost money. Sketching it out roughly, I showed her why not.
But what is Bitcoin? was her eminently sensible question. I explained, as concisely as I could, how Bitcoin is a digital currency, whose ledger is maintained on the blockchain. I watched as the penny dropped when she started to realize the implications of property which is absolute. I compared it to the field where her",0

Ownership of the field and grazing rights was the cause of some strife for her and some government intervention from the council. We discussed inflation, which she was seeing in her life in the rising costs of the blacksmith and the feed she supplemented the dry grass with. I explained, as briefly as I could, how Bitcoin is decentralized and how crucial that is in determining its value. She had never heard of any altcoins I think I once heard Elon talk about some kind of currency",0

Then I asked her why she had her laptop with her. She told me she was curious. She had very little spare cash, she said, but she had seen how convinced I was in our first conversation. What she had heard during our conversation that day had helped her make up her mind. She wanted to buy a few euros worth.
I set her up with an encrypted email, a password manager and a wallet. Then we made our agreement. I told her I would pay for my daughter and I to go for a beach ride together with her. I",0
btc_1c1e80109e5c6e1a8fb3b413f61ed90f_train587,"would send her the euro amount in Bitcoin. We would wait to take that ride for bitcoin to double in value. Its an agreement which still stands between us. That was in May 2021, when one Bitcoin was 44,000. We still ride often together but were still waiting for Bitcoin to reach 88,000. That will be an alltime high to remember.
After I got her set up and explained what an orange pill was, I thought she would be well and truly done with talking about Bitcoin. Instead, she settled back in her chair. Where did Bitcoin come from? she asked. I put on a fresh pot of coffee.

BTC trades flat while 'whales' remove bitcoin from exchanges en masse
The Sept. 29 Market Wrap discussed a potential uptrend because bitcoin had been reaching a series of higher lows, implying that buyers are willing to acquire BTC at higher prices.
Subsequent lows retraced on both Oct. 1 and Oct. 2, although this moderation occurred on the weekend when trading volume is lighter than during the week.
Mondays volume was 40 of the 20day average, where Saturday and",0

Investors may not have to abandon hope for a resumption of an uptrend, although price action seems to favor sideways trading.
A look at BTCs hourly chart on Monday shows the price pushing past the upper range of its Bollinger Band. Bollinger Bands are a technical indicator that plots an assets average price and subsequently calculates two standard deviations above and below that average.
Statistically, an assets price stays within two standard deviations of its average 95 of the time, making the breach of an upper or lower bound meaningful to watch.
While prices on the hourly chart have",0
btc_525a8c40c4bbdd114a564d7277dbdf3b_train601,"breached the top end of the Bollinger Bands, BTCs daily chart shows its price is situated within a close range of the median price. Todays activity may be merely pushing BTC back to a recognized average and is not providing a catalyst to push it significantly past its current level.
Derivative and onchain activity implies an underlying support that could prevent prices from falling significantly. Funding rates for BTC have been positive for seven consecutive days, and for 16 of the last 20.
Funding rates can serve as a measure of sentiment, as investors who wish to be long BTC pay investors who wish to be short. In conjunction with this is a sharp decline in whale net volume to exchanges.

Centralized exchanges have also seen significant BTC outflows.

diy_Beˈtõ_train622,"Introduction: Bet
This is an excerpt of a project containing more than the objects shown.
Here I will concentrate on material combinations including concrete.
In an experimental way of working materials and techniques that appear to be foreign to one another are combined so that they seem to work against each other but also develop a new surface feel and unusual aesthetics. By using primarily concrete and metal fabrics a certain heaviness, strength and monumentality are symbolized. However the objects illustrate fragility, lightness and transparency by their structure at the same time. Those unities of contradictions are found all throughout the work.
The combination of concrete and metal is not new; reinforced concrete is a widelyused construction material. Working in a different manner during this project, the materials exchange their wellknown features",0
diy_Beˈtõ_train623,"with new qualities. Two massive materials form a fragile, light and transparent structure. By using unconventional methods, new associations are created and unusual combinations are formed.
Some examples are the treatment of metal tissues with concrete elements and paper fibers, lasercutting felt and the addition of fluid concrete afterwards and the use of beeswax on concretemetalcombinations.
photos: Matthias Ritzmann
Step 1: First Experimental Material Tests
Metal tissues have been treated with concrete serving as a base. Afterwards further materials have been added to those objects so that they gained additional characteristics and changed their visual appearance and their surface feel. Through the addition of beeswax, fibers of hemp and pine, rice paper and a polyurethane elastomer the fabrics become more flexible, softer, fixed and more stable.
Step 2: Working Concentrated on Several Material",0
diy_Beˈtõ_train624,"Combinations
materials:

water
metal textiles
additional materials such as:
paper fibers
beeswax
polyurethane
tools:
perforated plate
plastic wrap

weights
1. Spread out plastic wrap on a small area on a table. Place a metal textile on the plastic wrap and the perforated plate on top of it. Use some weights to hold down the mesh and the plate.
2. Mix the concrete; you can find help how to do so here: REPLACEDLINK CONCRETEHowToMixConcrete 3. Use the putty knife to spread the fluid concrete on the perforated plate and push it through the cutouts. Wait a moment before you remove the plate. After you removed it, carefully place plastic wrap on top of the moist concrete. Let it dry for about one day. For some objects I ended the process after this step.
4. I combined the concretemetalcombination with paper fibers of",0
diy_Beˈtõ_train625,"hemp and pine. Therefore I made some thin layers of paper in which I embedded the concrete metal and let it dry.
5. Other variations with beeswax, rice paper or a polyurethane elastomer are possible. There is no right or wrong way how to do so; it is a process of trial and error.
Step 3: Results
During the project, material experiments became increasingly important. On the one hand it resulted in textile objects with a sculptural appearance. On the other hand concrete and metal are essential materials within the building industry. Therefore, there is also an architectonic aspect recognizable in the project. It is an attempt to generate concretemetalcombinations which communicate a certain lightness and transparency. Indeed, the work is in the phase of the experiment, nevertheless the approaches shall",0

seemed to fall violently upon the calm seaseemed to shatter themselves
upon an adamantine surface into sparkling dust, into a dazzling vapor
of light that blinded the eye and wearied the brain with its unsteady
brightness. Captain Whalley did not look at it. When his Serang, approaching the
roomy cane armchair which he filled capably, had informed him in a low
voice that the course was to be altered, he had risen at once and had
remained on his feet, face forward, while the head of his ship swung
through a quarter of a circle. He had not uttered a single word, not
even the word to steady the helm. It was the Serang, an elderly, alert,
little Malay, with a very dark skin, who murmured",0

helmsman. And then slowly Captain Whalley sat down again in the
armchair on the bridge and fixed his eyes on the deck between his feet. He could not hope to see anything new upon this lane of the sea. He had
been on these coasts for the last three years. From Low Cape to Malantan
the distance was fifty miles, six hours' steaming for the old ship with
the tide, or seven against. Then you steered straight for the land, and
byandby three palms would appear on the sky, tall and slim, and with
their disheveled heads in a bunch, as if in confidential criticism of

it obliquely, would",0

upstream, as she had done once every month for these seven years or
more, long before he was aware of her existence, long before he had ever
thought of having anything to do with her and her invariable voyages.
The old ship ought to have known the road better than her men, who had

diy_Tesla Coil Night Light_train660,"Introduction: Tesla Coil Night Light
This project celebrated the color green by using wireless power from a desktop, DIY Tesla Coil to illuminate a pair of colored, minifluorescent lamps.
TC construction was fairly easy using a kicker coil from Science First cat 262010; Buffalo, NY. With this component you won't need to build a separate spark gap. Just wire your caps in series with the included gap along along w four pancake turns of 10 grounding wire. for the primary as indicated in the basic schematic. Then wind about 400 turns of 24 magnet wire for the secondary. I found a wood sofa leg and wrapped it in plastic mailing tape to make the secondary coil form.
Connect a REPLACEDLINK amp variac to the input lugs of the stepup coil which",0
diy_Tesla Coil Night Light_train661,"will kick up line voltage several notches; subsequent increases in voltage occur as the primary circuit resonates w the secondary. Top off the secondary w a donut shaped wood form covered w copper tape or foil. Attach a power cord to the variac and mount everything in on a wood box. I threaded the primary wire through predrilled holes of plastic strips cut from coat hangers and then screwed the assembly to the box top. Lastly, accessorize w neon indicator lights, an On Off switch, fuse and bold warning labels.
A professional coiler bench tested the TC and recommended a second capacitor deck for a total of REPLACEDLINK uFd. This mod led to almost 5 cm sparks at a resonant frequency of REPLACEDLINK REPLACEDLINK BTW, there's a small DC",0
diy_Tesla Coil Night Light_train662,"fan located under the gap to cool the contacts. The 12 V DC supply was positioned in the upper right corner of the box and ran off the variac.
I mounted two mini fluorescents on either side of the secondary as light sources. When the spark gap was adjusted for the lowest variac setting, the night light ran continuously for 4 hours! The internal components were barely warm to the touch.
Caution: As w any line powered TC, even this small unit can bite like a cranky piranha if disrespected. So use care when the project is powered up and never operate it unattended.

diy_Shower Monitor Arduino with LCD display_train666,"Introduction: Shower Monitor Arduino With LCD Display
Welcome! For our Environmental Capstone class senior thesis for St. Olaf College we built a monitor that would effectively monitor how much water a shower uses. The idea behind this water monitor is that if you attach a piezo transducer small microphone to a shower pipe, you can calibrate the average of the vibrations while the shower is turned on, and from there you can see how much water you're using for that shower. For our project we made four different monitors using the same process. This instructable is written as if you were to make a single water monitor.
Here is all the equipment used for this project. These materials are to make one water monitor: One Pelican 1010 case One Arduino",0

For most of our equipment, we visited our local RadioShack, Menards, and REPLACEDLINK Otherwise we we able to access things from our college's electronics lab.

For the circuitry we started by using a large breadboard, then a smaller breadboard, and then finally a small protoboard. Our design comes from this instructable by stacey K. We took the original idea and tried it out on a large breadboard, and then got smaller and smaller until we were able to fit all into the 1 square protoboard.
For the connections from the arduino and the potentiometer to the LCD display we followed this Instructable's directions.

diy_Shower Monitor Arduino with LCD display_train669,"we had Pin 3 connect to the potentiometer.
When you are connecting the battery to the protoboard, you'll need to cut off the connector so you can solder the wires directly into the protoboard.
After all of the circuitry was soldered, we soldered the LCD display and the Arduino, as well as the straided wire that had gone through the case, and was attached to the molded piezo to the circuitry board.
Step 2: Code
Lots of testing and rechecking happened to make the code what it is right now. Things might work differently for your plumbing systems or if you use different equipment throughout the process. This code worked for our project using the equipment and methods that we used.

For the water monitor's case we ordered Pelican 1010 cases, as they're a perfect size for all of the parts that were used. Once we received them and removed the small carabiner we used a drill press to make a small hole in the backside of the case. This hole will allow for the wires to connect from the piezo transducer to the aruduino, protoboard, and ultimately the LCD display. We measured the width of",0
diy_Shower Monitor Arduino with LCD display_train677,"the cord we used and made a hole a little smaller, just so that there would be less room for moisture to get into the case.
For the rubber inset of the case we used a leather hole punch to punch a small hole in the material. Make sure the holes line up fairly well! The hole in the rubber inset can be smaller as it will be able to expand for the wire to pass through.
Lastly we used some silicone around the hole on the outside of the case where the wire stuck out, just to make sure that absolutely no moisture got into the case. Although the cases aren't under direct water, they're in an environment with plenty of moisture, so insulating the circuitry and wires is",0
diy_Shower Monitor Arduino with LCD display_train678,"key!
We were able to nestle everything Arduino, Protoboard, Battery, LCD, and wires into the inside of the case nicely. For two of our models we glued the LCD screen to the top of the case to show consumers how much water they're using during their shower time.
The pictures show the hole we drilled into the case, how we made the hole in the rubber inset, and what the rubber inset looked like after the hole punch was made.
Step 4: Piezo Mold
We looked into working with large piezos, small piezos, and even flexible piezos. Which piezo you decide to work with will change how you test the arduino and ultimately how you use a mold.
We used a small piezo since it was the piezo that gave us the best",0
diy_Shower Monitor Arduino with LCD display_train679,"results. For the epoxy mold we used JB Weld SteelStik. Wear gloves when handling epoxy! We placed a small piece of rubber on a piece of shower piping that we bought, secured it with a rubber band at either side, and placed a small portion of mixed epoxy on the rubber. After we had shaped the epoxy we placed the piezo on top of it and fashioned another small piece of mixed epoxy on top of that to secure the piezo. Make sure the wires aren't entirely covered! The epoxy that we used set very quickly. We let this cure for 24 hours.
When the mold has cured you can remove it from the pipe and rubber. When you have tested the piezo to make sure it works, or",0
diy_Shower Monitor Arduino with LCD display_train680,"if you want to just go for it, solder the piezo's wires to the wires that connect to the LCD, Arduino, and protoboard Which has already been fixed through the case.
After we had tested the molded piezo to make sure everything was working correctly, we soldered the piezo's wires to the wires that are connected to the arduino protoboard. After soldering these wires, we used heat shrink wrapping around that connection.
We then molded more epoxy to the piezo and the straided wires so that the connection would receive less damage from outside forces.
The first picture is of the piezo curing to the rubber which is on the piece of pipe, the second picture is a close up of what the piezo looks like after taking it off of",0
diy_Shower Monitor Arduino with LCD display_train681,"the shower piping and rubber.
Step 5: Testing and Implementation
It's important to keep testing throughout your creative process to make sure that everything is functioning accordingly. We had a couple issues with one piezo we used, a few of the op amps for the protoboard, and the code was a continuous work in progress.
For testing we used a five gallon bucket and changed the code based on whether or not the display reading was close to 5 gallons. For the tests we looked at averages of the results and changed the threshold in the programming to reflect that threshold.
For implementation we hooked up four monitors to different showers, and each monitor ran for about 2430 hours BUT this was with two batteries instead of one. Some of our plans",0
diy_Shower Monitor Arduino with LCD display_train682,"for future development include replacing the 9 volt battery with a polymer lithium ion battery, so that the monitor would be rechargeable and last much longer.

diy_Projection mapped audio visualization_train689,"Introduction: Projection Mapped Audio Visualization
I'm throwing a party, and since the party is meant to be a bit of an AV experience, I'm trying to design and add as many AV elements as possible. This is one of them an audio visualization using 3D projection mapping. The idea is pretty simple: have a set of boxes in a set layout each box represents a band of the audio spectrum. So when a bass note plays, the bass box lights up, and the same for the rest of the frequencies.
So the route I've chosen is as follows:
Sound source my laptop sound analysis processing broadcast sound analysis data processing OSC receive data and projection map accordingly VPT
I hope that doesn't sound too confusing. There are easier ways, but this allows",0
diy_Projection mapped audio visualization_train690,"for quite a large degree of flexibility and loads of room to add on other cool bits.
Shall we get stuck in, then?
Step 1: Bill of Materials
Not much is really needed for this instructable, but here's a list:
Hardware: A laptop a desktop is possible, but portability REPLACEDLINK A projector size and power is up to you Boxes or something you want to project onto White spray paint Microphone optional
Software: Processing as well as controlP5, netP5 and oscP5 libraries VPT great free projection mapping tool. I'm using version 7. Link: REPLACEDLINK Something to play your tunes iTunes?
Note on the boxes: I went down to my local supermarket loading depot and found a huge selection of boxes for free. Give it a go and be a bit more green :
Step 2:",0
diy_Projection mapped audio visualization_train691,"Audio Meets Processing then OSC
Firstly, you'll need an audio source to process. This can be from a microphone, a song, etc. Since the music would be playing from my laptop, I wanted to analyse this source. This means activating and selecting Stereo Mix as the default recording device on my sound panel. A bit of googling on how to do that saves me having to go through it. It's pretty easy to do.
Now that you have an audio source, we need to dive into the code: 3D projection mapping with VPT via OSC

A quick run through:
Audio is loaded into a buffer. That buffer is FFTed and averaged into 9 bands. Those bands are iterated through to get their value with a range of about 0 to 1 hence a floating point value. That value is concatenated with a string that corresponds to an OSC command destined for VPT. That string is then broadcast over",0
diy_Projection mapped audio visualization_train695,"OSC on IP address REPLACEDLINK port number 6666. There's also a GUI that shows the frequencies for each band, and a Gain knob, which can boost the signal if your source is a bit soft.
Note: I've never worked with audio analysis before this, so I admit my algorithm for getting an accurate spectrum is probably a little off. If anyone is more clued up on this, I'd love to hear a better way to go about it I have a feeling it's with some tasty maths!
Step 3: OSC Meets VPT
Now that we have our data up in the OSC air, we're going to catch it in VPT.
Install VPT and learn how to use it using the very helpful guide included. Also be sure you're comfortable with the method",0
diy_Projection mapped audio visualization_train696,"of saving your work I learnt this the hard way a couple of REPLACEDLINK Start off by adding layers and assigning sources to them. If you are using boxes to project onto, you'll need three layers per box and also to change the processing code to send each band three times this is currently in the code but commented out. If you are using single sided objects, you can leave the code as is and create 6 layers in VPT I know there are 9 bands, hence there should be 9 layers, but as you may notice, band 0 almost subsonic bass is multiplied by 0, and the very upper bands aren't really worth looking at.
As you may have guessed, the effect is created by fading each layer",0
diy_Projection mapped audio visualization_train697,"according to the level of the band linked to that layer. This means you can assign any source to the layer and still get the same effect. I even ran it using the webcam as a source out of curiosity an easy way to get your processor in quite a fluster.
Step 4: VPT Meets Terra Firma
I found setting my projector to extend display, dragging VPT windows onto the extended display and entering fullscreen mode meant I could keep my laptop screen free for the processing app and media player.
Here's an extremely short clip with an extremely bad camera showing the result of a test with one box:
VPT OSC test from Nic Shackle on Vimeo.
Step 5: To REPLACEDLINK I wouldn't quite call this project finished, since I still have",0
diy_Projection mapped audio visualization_train698,"some refinements and qualms: Projecting onto boxes that are stacked on next to each other means you end up projecting one layer on to two boxes on the faces where they meet. You can get around this by creating a mask for each layer, but this is almost impossibly fiddly. It's a lot easier to project onto isolated boxes or 2D objects such as boards etc. I'm not entirely happy with the abruptness of the fading. I will need to add some sort of easing algorithm into the processing code to make a smoother show. I need to paint the boxes white. Improved spectrum analysis?

There is no information on whether McDonalds is keeping the BTC or selling them immediately after for Swiss Francs CHF. In addition to it, Lightning Network LN payments take usually a few seconds to be processed, which makes the whole payment process even faster and easier for the user and the merchant.
Lugano is one of the largest cities in Switzerland and the third financial centre in the country. The city has been focusing on Bitcoin and adopting cryptocurrencies, in a similar way as El Salvador has done over the last year.
Michele Foletti, the governor of the city, explained their goal",0
btc_8bc106b4378b70d11191b9a2295c0950_train710,"of adopting Bitcoin and digital currencies:
Lugano is investing in its future. In the last few years, we have already implemented solutions based on blockchain technology, among them, the application MyLugano with its token LVGA Points, the digital franc of Lugano, and the blockchain infrastructure 3Achain.
In addition, he mentioned that the city believes in this technology and in the potential use for largescale projects. It is also worth pointing out that Paolo Ardoino, CTO of Tether, is involved in PlanBs project and is influencing the decisions taking part in Lugano.
In a recent press release, Paolo Ardoino mentioned:
Earlier this year, Lugano and Tether signed a memorandum of understanding to launch a strategic collaboration through several initiatives, including to help local businesses integrate their existing payment services with the permitted stablecoins",0

The payments processed by Mcdonalds are also linked to the collaboration that they established with GoCrypto, a platform that will also support payments in other digital currencies.
The goal is to support over 2,000 customers with the PlanB project. At the same time, by the end of the next year, the PlanB Foundation aims to enable more than 2,500 merchants to start accepting Bitcoin, Tether and LVGA. In this way, Lugano will become one of the cities in the world with the largest number of shops accepting Bitcoin and other digital currencies.",0

CivilWar veteran, who had taken up the wilderness land in 1865 and

the elder Ferris had wrenched only a meager living from the light and

Make sure the correct maletomale wires are connected in the breadboard, since the breadboard works in a way that all the holes in the same row are connected. Also, all the maletomale wires need to be in the right entrance at the arduino to the code work.
Step 4: Now, the Resistors and the Button
Place the resistors and buttons connected to the maletomale wires in the same row to make the code work. The button will work as a traffic button for pedestrians to change the light whenever they like. Connect the button to digital pin 12.

btc_9537552575157f5af1de710b6ebe61e5_train783,"Its hard not to be curious about the wild volatility of cryptocurrency bitcoin, which has hit some crazy highs and lows in recent months. The belowmentioned portion will give you a rundown of the three main causes that have led the price of bitcoin into this frenzied state and how they may play out in the coming days. Read here to check if the looming bitcoin regulation will crush investor.
Bitcoin is often referred to as digital gold or digital cash, with its price determined by supply and demand on an opensource online platform where anyone can interact directly with each other for value exchange through a currency transfer system known as Bitcoin trading or Bitcoin exchanges. There is no central bank or government controlling bitcoin, nor is its",0
btc_9537552575157f5af1de710b6ebe61e5_train784,"value pegged to any single fiat currency such as the dollar or euro. Instead, the price of bitcoin is determined by supply and demand on a global scale.
Bitcoins are created when a transaction, either through the sending or receiving of bitcoins through various digital exchanges, is validated with computers in a peertopeer network running the Bitcoin Core software. So let all prospects lead to an alltime high of bitcoin. Inflation:
Bitcoin was established as a currency separate from the banking system, and thus it is not tied to any specific country or region. In practice, this means that bitcoins are not affected by inflation rates in any country. The rate of new bitcoin creation slows daily as the number of bitcoins approaches its preset ceiling. There are 100 million",0
btc_9537552575157f5af1de710b6ebe61e5_train785,"available bitcoins, and only 21 million will be created by 2140. Obsolescence:
Users can also remove bitcoins from circulation by permanently deleting them from the Bitcoin network. As of 2022, over 85percent of all the 21 million possible bitcoins have been mined REPLACEDLINK million out of a total 21 million, and many more people are mining daily. However, users will not mine enough for the foreseeable future to increase the supply of bitcoins in circulation. In other words, the price of bitcoins cannot be pushed by anyone up or down to accommodate demand or other economic factors. Bitcoin Hard fork:
Bitcoin hard forks refer to situations where two competing protocol versions exist simultaneously. It can happen when two miners jointly create a new block and split off from both, intentionally",0
btc_9537552575157f5af1de710b6ebe61e5_train786,"creating two separate and consequently different blockchain networks. Bitcoin hard forks can lead to higher transaction fees and slower confirmation times during network congestion, resulting in more network traffic due to the need for new blocks. Institutional adoption:
Institutional investors are hesitant to invest due to uncertainty and confusion over cryptocurrencies regulatory framework. However, if a country or a significant financial institution comes out with official regulations that embrace bitcoin, this could drive up demand. In particular, Japan has become a hotbed for bitcoin activity, which makes sense as it has been a leader in cryptocurrency adoption since early 2021. Mainstream Adoption:
As bitcoin has matured as a cryptocurrency, more companies have been warming to using various bitcoin exchanges to gain exposure to the volatile bitcoin price. In contrast, a",0
btc_9537552575157f5af1de710b6ebe61e5_train787,"few websites such as WordPress, Reddit and Flatter have begun accepting donations in bitcoin. However, the volatility of bitcoin has been changing in the recent month after hitting some record highs and lows but could go higher if the right set of circumstances comes together. REPLACEDLINK is one of Americas most popular cryptocurrency exchanges and wallet services, with nearly 8 million users. Coinbase serves more than 30 countries across Europe, Asia and America with many payment methods supported credit cards, debit cards, bank transfers or digital currencies such as Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum. The Halving:
The number of Bitcoins created with each new block is cut in half at a preset rate. The next halving event is expected to occur on July 9, 2024. As a result, the value",0
btc_9537552575157f5af1de710b6ebe61e5_train788,"of this reward has dropped from 50 bitcoins per block initially to REPLACEDLINK in 2012 and is reduced further to REPLACEDLINK bitcoins after the recent halving event in July 2020.
The Wild West has always been a fascinating place for many people, which has undoubtedly been the case with bitcoin and cryptocurrencies over the past several years. For example, the famous Winklevoss twins are two of the earliest bitcoin investors and started repurchasing bitcoins in 2012. Likewise, the Winklevoss twins were early investors in bitcoin, buying 11 million worth of the cryptocurrency in 2013 when it was selling for just 120 a coin.
The bitcoin scaling debate has been going on for a couple of years now, with disagreements on how to scale Bitcoin. Unfortunately, due to the disagreements, two",0
