aluminum wire tends to jam up in a conventional wirefeed welder. So people get
these spoolguns. They also get them for confined spaces and to work longer
distances from the powersupply unit. I bought this spoolgun on Ebay for under 100. There's no brand name on it and
no provision for shielding gas. It's well made and works great for fluxcore

called out to them: You'll be smashed or drowned, I'm sure you will!
But farewell, and good riddance to you. The Ork was provoked by this unkind speech, so he turned his tail

the section for an example of working with polymorphic fields. Serialization techniques Parceler offers several choices for how to serialize
and deserialize an object in addition to the fieldbased serialization seen
above. Getter setter serialization Parceler may be configured to
serialize using getter and setter methods and a nonempty constructor. In
addition, fields, methods and constructor parameters may be associated using
the @ParcelProperty annotation. This supports a number of bean strategies
including immutability and traditional getter setter beans. To configure
default method serialization, simply configure the @Parcel annotation with

Java call looks just like the call does in native code. Most calls require no
special handling or configuration; no boilerplate or generated code is
required. JNA uses a small JNI library stub to dynamically invoke native code.
The developer uses a Java interface to describe functions and structures in
the target native library. This makes it quite easy to take advantage of
native platform features without incurring the high overhead of configuring
and building JNI code for multiple platforms. Read this more indepth

You can access the underlying exception by catching HttpRequestException and
calling getCause which will always return the original IOException. Are requests asynchronous? No. The underlying HttpUrlConnection object
that each HttpRequest object wraps has a synchronous API and therefore all

not use an HttpRequest object on the main thread of your application. Here
