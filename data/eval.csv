diy_Persistence of Vision (PoV) Display Using Arduino _valid13,"Introduction: Persistence of Vision PoV Display Using Arduino
Time for a funfilled, easypeasy Japaneasy to make a project! Today, were going to show you how to make an LED POV Display. POV, an acronym for the persistence of vision, is a kind of optical illusion in which a visual image seems to persist even when the light from it ceases to enter our eyes and this makes it super cool! You can display any text or image that you want to in the display.
Sounds awesome, right? So, why are you still here?! Lets begin right away!
Step 1: List of Components Needed
Step 2: Understanding Some Basic Concepts
What is Persistence of Vision?
Persistence of Vision, or POV, occurs when a visual image seems to persist continuously when a stream of light is",0
diy_Persistence of Vision (PoV) Display Using Arduino _valid14,"repeatedly interrupted for very brief instances and does not enter our eyes during those durations.
How does the Persistence of Vision works?
The human eye cannot process more than 1012 images per second. When a series of images more is presented in quick succession, it gives us the illusion that the images are in motion.
This is the basic principle behind the making of the animated movies.
Step 3: Printing the 3D Printed Part
Here we are going to 3D Print the holder to which we will be fixing our complete assembly. Download the .STL given below.
The Holder consists of two parts. The Rotating Part The Stable Part
Step 4: Assembling the LEDs
Once you have the 3D Printed parts with you, its time to start the making.
Take the General Purpose Board and cut it",0
diy_Persistence of Vision (PoV) Display Using Arduino _valid15,"in the size that fits the Rotating part.
Once done, its time to add the LEDs.
In this project, I have used 8 red LEDs, you can use as many and of any color you want.
Once done, short common the cathode terminal of all the LEDs by soldering them on the GPB.
Add resistors to protect the LEDs from blowing up due to high voltage supply 5V. I have used the 220ohm resistors. Solder one end of each resistor to the anode terminal or positive leg of each LED.
Solder jumper cables to the second leg of each resistor.
Step 5: Connection With Arduino Nano
Connect all the LEDs to Arduino Nano as given below: LED0: D2 of nano LED1: D3 of nano LED2: D4 of nano LED3: D5 of nano LED4: D6 of",0
diy_Persistence of Vision (PoV) Display Using Arduino _valid16,"nano LED5: D7 of nano LED6: D8 of nano LED7: D9 of nano Common cathode: Ground of nano
Step 6: Attaching the DC Motor
Attach the DC Motor to the given space in the holder.
Power the DC Motor using evive.
Step 7: Adding IR Sensor
It's time to add the IR Sensor.
As we need to indicate the beginning from where the text should be written. Attach a small piece of white paper to the steady assembly, which will be detected by the IR Sensor.
Varying the place of the paper leads to a change in the position of the text displayed.
Connect it to Nano: GND: GND of nano Vin: 5v of nano Out: D10 of nano
Step 8: Completing the Assembly.
We need to power up the Nano. For that, connect the battery to it.
Once",0
diy_Persistence of Vision (PoV) Display Using Arduino _valid17,"done, fix the Nano into the Rotating Part.
Fasten the Rotating Part to the holder.
Step 9: Arduino Code
Upload the following code to Arduino Nano:
Attachments
Step 10: Working
When the IR sensor detects the white paper, the LEDs start glowing and create the illusion that something is displayed by the LED. This is due to the persistence of vision, where the LEDs turn on and off in such a way that the different images overlap each other forming letters.
Step 11: Conclusion
With this, your very own LED POV Display is all set to display the message of your choice!

Hi,
The DC Motor that is being used here is the one that you get in the generic BO Motor. If you take out the plastic covering, you will be left with this motor.
Happy DIYing :

Hi. I built this and although it seems to work, I cannot distinguish any characters",0
diy_Persistence of Vision (PoV) Display Using Arduino _valid19,"when I look at it. Is LED0 supposed to be the led closest to the motor? Also wondering if the motor Im using is not fast enough it spins at 250 rpm. Thanks again for posting the REPLACEDLINK was fun to build.
Answer 3 years ago
Thank you for your kind words. Try increasing the rpm as to have the illusion the rotation needs to be at least more than 1012 turns per second. Also, do not keep the LED0 near the motor. Hope you find this useful. :

diy_DIY SRAM_valid36,"Introduction: DIY SRAM
Static RandomAccess Memory. What is it?
SRAM is a type of memory that will store information, but lose it when power is disconnected, which is why it is RAM. It is called static RAM because it doesn't need to be refreshed, unlike Dynamic RAM DRAM which has to be refreshed every few milliseconds to keep its data. DRAM is common in computer memory, because of fast access times and it only requires 1 transistor and 1 capacitor per bit making it high density. SRAM is common among microcontroller memory and some low power applications because it doesn't need to be refreshed, and uses less power. It is slower than DRAM and has a lower density at 6 transistors per cell.
This instructable will show you how you can",0
diy_DIY SRAM_valid37,"make a SRAM bit using the real design, not the register versions I previously demonstrated. The SRAM is the 6t circuit, meaning that this version uses 6 transistors per bit in reality, ours will need 8 per bit.
Why build such a device, when you can get an IC with a few thousand times more storage?
Because its cool to see how those little chips actually work. Plus you can say that you made your own REPLACEDLINK and maybe tell all your friends that your computer is running off of homemade REPLACEDLINK Step 1: Get the Stuff 8 2N7000 transistors These are Nchannel MOSFETs 4 BS250 transistors These are Pchannel MOSFETs 1 LED 1 Resistor to match LED current 220 1K will be fine. REPLACEDLINK is a good calculator if",0
diy_DIY SRAM_valid38,"you aren't sure 2 Buttons 2 Resistors 1k to 10k will work Wires A breadboard A 5ish Volt Power Supply
Step 2: The Circuit
The 6t SRAM Circuit is relatively simple. It is 2 CMOS inverters with an enable circuit on both sides. The output of one inverter is connected to the input of the other and vice versa. This creates a very simple latch because when one of the inputs is low, that inverter's output goes high, this makes the other inverter's input high, so its output is now low. To change the inverters' states, you would pulse a high current on the low side AND a low current on the high side. This pulse is enough to change the input of that inverter, so the output changes, and",0
diy_DIY SRAM_valid39,"the circuit latches again, but in the opposite state. It is bistable, and won't freely oscillate. The enables connect and disconnect it from the rest of the circuit, so that it can't be accidentally changed when a bunch of them are connected together.
Step 3: What on Earth Is CMOS
CMOS seemoss does NOT grow in water. It is a type of logic that uses MOSFETs and it uses very little current. CMOS stands for complementary metaloxide semiconductor The MOS part is also the same for the first part of MOSFET This doesn't mean that the transistors compliment each other, but that they complement, as in the opposite, each other. CMOS uses both an Nchannel MOSFET and a Pchannel MOSFET.
How does it work?
The Nchannel MOSFET will turn on when it's",0
diy_DIY SRAM_valid40,"gate is brought up to the supply voltage, typically REPLACEDLINK or 5v, and turn off when the gate it brought down to ground.
The Pchannel MOSFET will turn on when it's gate is brought down to ground and turn off when it's gate is brought up to the supply.
What is neat is that when one is on, the other is off. The pictures above demonstrate how this works for the humble inverter also known as a NOT gate
Step 4: The Enable Circuit
The first thing we have to tackle is the Enable Transistor. The schematic shows that all you need is one Nchannel MOSFET to be the enable. That, however, is an ideal MOSFET. An ideal MOSFET is a symmetrical device that can switch currents in both directions. The 2N7000",0
diy_DIY SRAM_valid41,"is not an ideal MOSFET, there is a small diode built into it that is parallel with the actual FET. This means that current can be switched on and off when flowing in one direction, but it will flow freely through the other direction whether the FET is on or off. I don't know why the MOSFETs are made that way, it is probably a manufacturing thing. My guess is that for some reason, it is easier to make MOSFETs with a diode than without.
To counter this, we put 2 FETs together with their diodes facing opposite directions. That way, current can't flow in either direction freely UNLESS the MOSFET is switched on. This is why our SRAM will need 8 transistors instead of 6.
It should be noted",0
diy_DIY SRAM_valid42,"that most discrete MOSFETs have a body diode, as its called, in them.
Step 5: Our Circuit
Ok, so we have the SRAM circuit in the middle, but what the heck is all of the rest of that stuff?
The LED is simple, it is the output, so we know what the bit is set to. The write enable switch turns on the enables, allowing you to write to the SRAM. The Bit Line Switch is used to write the data to the SRAM. These switches need the pulldown resistors because the gates of MOSFETs are slightly capacitive, meaning that if you disconnect them from anything, they may hold their charge and stay switched on. The BL inverter is used to invert the signal to go to the NOT Bit Line.",0
diy_DIY SRAM_valid43,"Then the BL inverter reverts the signal to its original state. The reason for this second inverter is that the PullDown resistor doesn't draw enough current to switch the SRAM latch more on this in step 13 so to counter this, we just use another inverter.
Step 6: Let's Start the Fun Part
Ok, well the fun part also happens to be the tricky part. I took a lot of pictures so, hopefully, it won't be a scary, daunting task. The circuit starts out simple, but gets scary rather quickly. A picture is worth a thousand words actually a 10MP picture is about 10 million 32bit words, so I plan on a few words and a lot of pictures.
To start we are going to make the two inverters. They are",0
diy_DIY SRAM_valid44,"simply a BS250 and a 2N7000 with their drains connected together. To do this, the BS250 goes on the left, and the 2N7000 goes on the right. Both should have the rounded side facing you. WARNING: if the rounded side is facing away, then the body diodes will short the supply and ground, and the transistors will release their blue smoke! Also, the rightmost pin pin 3 of the BS250 and the leftmost pin pin 1 of the 2N7000 should be connected together.
Step 7: Connect Them Together
Now we are going to connect the inverters together. The output of one is connected to the input of the other. To do this, connect a wire to pin 2 of a transistor on the left inverter and connect it to the",0
diy_DIY SRAM_valid45,"output of the other transistor. The output of the inverter is where pin 3 of the BS250 and pin 1 of the 2N7000 are connected together. Repeat this, but with the input of the right inverter and the output of the left one.
If you are confused, refer to the picture.
Step 8: Add the Enable
The enable is simple. One 2N7000 has its rounded side facing you, the other has its flat side facing you. The rightmost pin of the left transistor is connected to the leftmost pin of the right transistor. Confused? The picture says it all, and then some. Next, the gates get connected together via a wire. Lastly, we need to connect the enable to the SRAM bit. To do this, put a wire on either the",0
diy_DIY SRAM_valid46,"very left or very right pin. Next, put the other end of the wire on the gate of the closest inverter.
Step 9: The Full Cell
Make another enable on the other side of the circuit, and connect it up if you connect both enables to the gate on both sides, you will guarantee that they aren't connected to the same side of the circuit. Now you have a full SRAM cell. Connect the gates of the enables together then connect another wire from ground to one of the gates.
Add the LED and resistor by putting a resistor on the output or gate of one inverter then to the positive lead of the LED and ground the negative lead of the LED. Now you may want to test in.
Plug in",0
diy_DIY SRAM_valid47,"your power supply and watch for the blue smoke! Actually, a better idea is to keep one hand on the switch, and touch the transistors with the other to make sure they don't get hot. If it passes that test, set one enable input to ground and the other to 5v or whatever you are using turn the supply on, and enable the circuit by disconnecting the gates from ground and setting to 5v. The LED should turn on, or off. If it hold its state, disable the circuit and switch the wires around, as in the input that was grounded should be set high and vice versa. If the LED still doesn't change, check your circuit.
Step 10: Buttons and Input Inverters
Wiring up the buttons is fairly straight",0
diy_DIY SRAM_valid48,"forward. One pin gets tied to 5v and the other is tied to ground through a resistor. The output of the button is the pin that is tied to ground. The Write Enable button output connected to the enable gates. The output of the Bit Line button is connected to the first inverter's input. It's output goes to the enable and to the second inverter's gate. It's output goes to the other enable. I'm not going into detail on building the inverters, because I already covered that.
Step 11: It's Finished
Now, its time to turn the power supply on again and try out your new RAM! If all goes well, you should be able to change the LED's state when the write enable is high, but it should latch",0
diy_DIY SRAM_valid49,"when the write enable it low.
Build a few thousand more of these, add some decoding logic and you have your own SRAM chip!
Step 12: More Information
This is a very efficient circuit and is what is used in most SRAM chips, but I found out that it isn't a perfect circuit. Remember how I said earlier that the resistor wasn't enough to change the circuit's state? Well, as it turns out, there is a very brief current spike when the circuit is switched. This spike lasts for less than a millisecond, but it is as high as 100 milliamps. This spike is caused by current rushing in through the enable and to ground through the output of the inverter. This spike is very brief because once the inverter is",0
diy_DIY SRAM_valid50,"switched, no more current flows. This spike can be reduced by using smaller MOSFETs like on an IC that have lower capacities and by grouping everything closer together which further reduces the capacitance.
This is the least complex memory circuit I've built so far. I have made a TTL RAM using an SR Flip Flop, and I made a CMOS RAM that used a D Latch, and I implemented that into a 1 Byte RAM for your favorite microcontroller.
Eventually I'm going to attempt a DRAM circuit and if I can find a few ferrite cores cheaply 5 for 100, I might try to make a Core Memory!!!

2. SRAM is faster compared to DRAM
3. SRAM consumes less power than DRAM
4. SRAM uses more transistors per bit of memory compared to DRAM

im not sure why you have so many transistors? also, you didnt really explain how it works.
i played around with sr latches last weekend, which is essentially what sram is.
you could make a simple 'bit ram' with 2 npns and 4 resistors, if you had a static output as in, the load on the output will always be the REPLACEDLINK motor, transistor REPLACEDLINK all it is, is 2 nand gates with crossed i o.",0
diy_DIY SRAM_valid52,"since 00 is a bad state, iv added a simple transistor inverter on each input in1 out 0; in0 out1 as to set it to a neutral state. added a transistor on each output so they both have an equal load. the outputs are coming from the resisterCollector junction.
one of them is a 2bit stack with master reset. REPLACEDLINK REPLACEDLINK hope it helps someone here

amuse these little girls she used now and then to invent stories,
for which, being extremely talented, she also drew and coloured the

and Crimson Linings. And then wasn't Little Black Sambo grand? So he put on all his Fine Clothes, and went out for a walk in the
Jungle. And by and by he met a Tiger. And the Tiger said to him, Little

Can a polygonal mesh be made affectionate? Using Autodesk's Maya Mudbox softwares, and in thinking of the many tools used for character animation in hollywood, I've attempted to imbue multiple formal and geometric studies with either an affection or repulsion effect, typically by using multiple modulatory tool types as applied to a primary geometry, such as a sphere. These modulations were also applied using a variety of displacement and textural procedure brushes in Mudbox. One set of metablobs were generated by using a set of displacement deformations in Autodesk Maya using the LEAP Motion interactive interfaceI invited two fellow AiR's Artists in Residence, Luis Rodriguez Bernie Lubell, to deform a sphere, and then 3d printed those, along with my own.

Hi Aditya kombe @adityaC3 here from Eupholabs hardware community to promote Makers and innovation. This time a guy came asking me to make a bike protection system so that if he knew the bike is stolen he could call his bike security number and stop it on the way with all lights and horn blinking like REPLACEDLINK here he had REPLACEDLINK took me this list REPLACEDLINK uno REPLACEDLINK module REPLACEDLINK REPLACEDLINK perf board REPLACEDLINK and 1k resister REPLACEDLINK Step 1: Whats the Tack????
Picture above clarifies the situation .However We all know we can generate a special tone by a cellphones keypad button that is a combination of two tones of different frequency.
What is DTMF?? visit REPLACEDLINK tonemulti REPLACEDLINK so every keypad",0
diy_Bike Security System Based on GSM Calling._valid96,"button has its own identity tone that can be broken down by a DTMF decoder ic say a HT9170 or 8870 . Shown in picture 2.
just tryna make a call and then press few keys , you hear some tones that are DTMF tones.
SO lets decode them and convert them into 4bit binary no. like 1 on keypad will be REPLACEDLINK lets fed this data to Arduino uno then lets decide we Trigger a Pin no. 13 HIGH in output mode to actuate relay.
thats it, we use Relay to cutoff spark plug supply, once relay is on we Use its NC and COM to make sure the spark supply currents gets broken when relay is REPLACEDLINK is stopped!!
use buzzer for sound!!!

Step 3: Relay and Buzzer
Here , i've managed to start relay and buzzer together by pin 13, You can actually use another pin for another one.
Do not power Relay directly by arduino , add a transistor say NPN BJT BC547 note you will get circuit on google or use the one i've uploaded
Or simply buy a Relay driver board.
Buzzer must be 5v configuration.
Led is for demo Process.",0

Step 4: Done!
Must watch the Video!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Connect Every thing Solder out Fix .
Do all the connections and Upload this sketch REPLACEDLINK You can use the REPLACEDLINK file for testing purpose dial 1 and Use serial port of arduino to detect.
As soon as you power up Module shows up nothing. Dont worry as soon as you add a cell Make a call ,Dial 1 pin number 13 gets digital HIGH and Press 2 pin 13 gets digital LOW.
Thank you!!keep making!!
if some1 asks you how will the phone automatically receive a call just make sure you use a keypad phone and solder a calling button to arduino and somehow short it by detecting vibration from REPLACEDLINK was just a demo REPLACEDLINK Participated in the

Hello, Very nice project. But I would like to ask if it is possible to add a sequence at startup, where you should login first then give commands to the arduino.
This way will be safer in use this project!

Outro ponto importante que foi mencionado durante a entrevista com o engenheiro da rea de manuteno foi o alto custo das propostas recebidas para sensorizar os equipamentos. Desta forma, mesmo como uma soluo altamente desejada, o cliente no pode ainda adquirila e acredito que usando a soluo da Qualcomm com a DragonBoard,",0

Step 2: Desafios Durante 45 De Desenvolvimento Do Projeto
Creio que um dos grandes desafios foi gerenciar o tempo nestes 45 dias e conseguir criar do zero toda a aplicao. Desde receber a dragonboard, testla, instalar linux, at aprender como interfacear com o IBM Bluemix e o Watson para receber dados dos sensores e armazenlos na nuvem.
