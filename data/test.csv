no wind came by day or night to shake the loose petals from their stems.
Along the basking, silent, manycolored shore gathered and lingered the
crisp odors of the mountains. The dust hung golden and motionless long
after the rider was behind the hill, and the Pacific lay like a floor
of sapphire, whereon to walk beyond the setting sun into the East. One
white sail shone there. Instead of an hour, it had been from dawn till
afternoon in sight between the short headlands; and the Padre had hoped
that it might be the ship his homesick heart awaited. But it had slowly
passed. From an arch in his garden cloisters he was now watching the
last of it. Presently it was gone, and",0

Padre put his glasses in his lap. For a short while he read in his
breviary, but soon forgot it again. He looked at the flowers and sunny
ridges, then at the huge blue triangle of sea which the opening of
the hills let into sight. Paradise, he murmured, need not hold more
beauty and peace. But I think I would exchange all my remaining years of
this for one sight again of Paris or Seville. May God forgive me such a
thought! Across the unstirred fragrance of oleanders the bell for vespers began
to ring. Its tones passed over the Padre as he watched the sea in his
garden. They reached his parishioners in their adobe dwellings near by.

that rode among the cattle paused, looking down like birds at the map
of their home. Then the sound widened, faint, unbroken, until it met
Temptation in the guise of a youth, riding toward the Padre from the
South, and cheered the steps of Temptation's jaded horse. For a day, one single day of Paris! repeated the Padre, gazing through
his cloisters at the empty sea. Once in the year the motherworld remembered him. Once in the year,

THE RED INN In I know not what year a Parisian banker, who",0
clean_data_prose_1433.txt_test63,"had very extensive
commercial relations with Germany, was entertaining at dinner one of
those friends whom men of business often make in the markets of the
world through correspondence; a man hitherto personally unknown to him.
This friend, the head of a rather important house in Nuremburg, was a
stout worthy German, a man of taste and erudition, above all a man
of pipes, having a fine, broad, Nuremburgian face, with a square open
forehead adorned by a few sparse locks of yellowish hair. He was the
type of the sons of that pure and noble Germany, so fertile in honorable
natures, whose peaceful manners and morals have never been lost, even
after seven invasions. This stranger laughed with simplicity, listened attentively, and drank
remarkably well, seeming to like champagne as much perhaps as he liked
his strawcolored Johannisburger. His",0
clean_data_prose_1433.txt_test64,"name was Hermann, which is that
of most Germans whom authors bring upon their scene. Like a man who does
nothing frivolously, he was sitting squarely at the banker's table and
eating with that Teutonic appetite so celebrated throughout Europe,
saying, in fact, a conscientious farewell to the cookery of the great
Careme. To do honor to his guest the master of the house had invited a few
intimate friends, capitalists or merchants, and several agreeable and
pretty women, whose pleasant chatter and frank manners were in harmony
with German cordiality. Really, if you could have seen, as I saw, this
joyous gathering of persons who had drawn in their commercial claws, and
were speculating only on the pleasures of life, you would have found
no cause to hate usurious discounts, or to curse bankruptcies. Mankind
can't always be doing",0

find a few sweet hours during which we could fancy their sinister craft

story to terrify us? These words were said at dessert by a pale fair girl, who had read, no
doubt, the tales of Hoffmann and the novels of Walter Scott. She was the

Both Bitcoin Whale And Leverage Ratios Are Around ATHs Right Now
As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, BTC investors are involved in some highrisk trading in the futures market currently.
The exchange whale ratio is an indicator that measures the ratio between the sum of the top ten inflows to exchanges, and the total exchange inflows.
Since the ten largest transfers to exchanges are assumed to be from the whales, this metric tells us about whether whales are active on the market right now or not.

It seems like usually whenever the indicator has hit a high and then subsequently started declining, the price has also taken a large hit.

btc_e1e037eb1fec123544fb140b0995586c_test122,"On July 28, 2010, users discovered that they could steal anothers Bitcoin by simply prepending any locked script with OPTRUE OPRETURN. Since the opcode OPRETURN halts execution of script like a return function in any programming language, it would return the previous value on the stack, OPTRUE, which returns a true condition allowing spending of anyones coins, regardless of their spending conditions.
This bug was quickly patched by Satoshi Nakamoto, changing the functionality of OPRETURN to immediately return false instead. However, with the understanding that Bitcoin does not operate outside of the law and miners would not process transactions with this script realistically, even if it was technically possible, we can now question if this was simply a technical oversight.
Satoshi infamously stated he believed few nodes will be big",0
btc_e1e037eb1fec123544fb140b0995586c_test123,"server farms. Thinking this through, this implies large corporations who would not allow crime to occur with impunity on their watch. Furthermore, these large corporate nodes would comply if instructed with freezing orders or asset seizure by government. That communication capability was implemented in Bitcoin early as well via the Alert system. BTC Core developers removed this functionality in 2016.
Today, many in the digital currency space believe asset seizure and freezing to be technically impossible, as the system is decentralized and it cannot be done due to being simple math. The reality is that the creator had implemented puzzle pieces for this to be possible from the early stages of the network, but due to its immaturity, the subsequent removal of those features have allowed newcomers to control",0
btc_e1e037eb1fec123544fb140b0995586c_test124,"the narrative on why they were removed. For example, regardless of Nakamotos intent, BTC Core gave their own subjective, interpretive reasons on why the Alert System should be removed:
The original features did not scale due to nodes being possible to run on home computers with little to no capital investment. Unlike large corporations who generate millions in revenue and must be registered legal entities, these home users cannot be trusted to follow judicial instruction, or to not steal anothers assets.
Craig Wright explains this in March 2020:
Even if the OPTRUE OPRETURN bug was technically possible on Bitcoin today, nodes would likely reject these scripts as they would essentially be guilty of facilitating crime. Therefore, a simple reimplementation of this bug from the original version of Bitcoin would implement the",0
btc_e1e037eb1fec123544fb140b0995586c_test125,"technology possible for miners to be able to freeze and return assets despite the experts claiming it is impossible.
If the solution implemented is not making OPTRUE OPRETURN scripts possible, then another is an agreement by nodes via a notarized contract. Nodes can now receive instructions from court orders to freeze assets or reassign coins. This implementation by the Bitcoin Association echoes Wrights sentiments in February 2022, doublingdown on the concept that network consensus should be achieved outside the technical capabilities of the blockchain:
This concept is a reminder that we live in the real world. Just because something is technically possible to achieve, does not mean it is morally right or legal. Bitcoin cannot scale to be money for the world if loss of possession results in loss of",0
btc_e1e037eb1fec123544fb140b0995586c_test126,"ownership, unlike any other asset in the world. Its also worth noting that the original Bitcoin white paper states that nodes protect ownership and not possessions.

It noted that an April survey by the REPLACEDLINK National Bureau of Economic Research found that just 20 of the population still uses the Chivo wallet.
The most important reason for not downloading the app it found, is that users prefer to use cash, which was followed by trust issues: Respondents did not trust the system or Bitcoin itself.

diy_Arduino Domino clock_test138,"component works, it is not that difficult really .. a lot of logic is involved.
During my journey i found out that you have to have and understanding for : Basic electronics. Read the Instructable. You'll still learn a lot! How to solder. How to use a multimeter etc. Writing code in C, or at least being able understand the code you are reading and how it does work.
You should also have patience and a generous amount of free time. :
Step 2: Component List
Here is what you need to make a The domino Clock : 21x LED's plus some extra for making mistakes! An arduino board 21 Higher current driver part like a ULN2803 2 push buttons 21 shift registers like a 74HC595 2x or 3x large prototype PCB",0
diy_Arduino Domino clock_test139,"s. The type with copper eyes. RTC Real Time Clock like a DS1307 21 metallic bolts insulated copper wire preferably a thick one Battery driving the RTC like a CR2032v with its holder 32 khz crystal oscillator Piece of wood for the casing of the clock some wires Resistors values will come under the steps Transistors values will come under the steps 21 small round regular magnet REPLACEDLINK mm x REPLACEDLINK mm
Step 3: Making the Flip Dots 1 you can visualize the timechanging effect using different methods, the easiest will be using some LED's wich will turn on and off .. but Heyyy .. how cool is that ! .. alternativly you can use a flipdots. you can buy these at : REPLACEDLINK REPLACEDLINK but come on ,",0
diy_Arduino Domino clock_test140,"this is instructables we are trying to make things from scratch, so we will be making a flipdot from scratch, firstable some theory about how flipdots operates you can take a loop to this website : REPLACEDLINK For Building the eletromagnet you will need : a insulated copper wires such as magnet wire a thick one, so you can avoid that magnet gets hot a metalic bolt a small round regular magnet REPLACEDLINK mm x REPLACEDLINK mm can be found here : REPLACEDLINK the support print the attached templates and cut them, and then glue them together Before getting to the exact building instructions i have to mention a couple of things, we are making an electromagnet as a part of an electronic circuit, it means that we",0
diy_Arduino Domino clock_test141,"have to take in consideration the Current going though the magnet, the resistans needed and not least the pulling force of the magnet, so it can match the regular magnet force we bought from the website, for that :
For the current :
The LED are limited to 20 mA, wich will not be enough to drive our electromagnet, that's why we are going to use a higher current driver part like a ULN2803 with its own current limit resistor for the magnet, The number of windings wire guage the core you use will all impact the impedance of the resulting coil hence its current draw.
For The resistans :
you can do it experimentally find a higher wattage variable resistor, put it in series with the supply, the coil, and the",0
diy_Arduino Domino clock_test142,"transistor, with the NPN transistor like the ULN2803 being the bottom of the string going to ground.
Add a resistor to ground to an input pin, and a switch to 5 so you can make it momentarily high to turn it on.
Dial the resistor to highest resistance, and slowly bring it down until you get your response, or until something smokes ! .. Oooops !
For the Pulling force :
Magnetic force I N where as I is current and N is amount of turns
So Now that we have an idea what we need lets make our flipdots REPLACEDLINK Step 4: Making the Flip Dots 2 Attachments
Step 5: The Hardware Part a Description
The first thing you need is :
An arduino board can be bought from : REPLACEDLINK Since it is a",0
diy_Arduino Domino clock_test143,"clock we are going to make if i didnt mention that before : then we are going to need some kind of timing mechanism, for that we can use : the internal arduino clock, wich is fine, but duriing my reserach a found out that it is not that accurate, and i wanted something accurate so i do not have to set the clock every time, so we are going to use a RTC Real Time Clock .. i am using : DS1307 documentation : REPLACEDLINK REPLACEDLINK We have track multiple outputs 21 in totals but we have limited output pins from our arduino board, to resolve that we are going to use shiftregisters, 74HC595 documentation : REPLACEDLINK what shift registers do basicly is taking a serial data",0
diy_Arduino Domino clock_test144,"and splitting it into a parallel ones, then combining the input data with a clock signal so we can get a syncronised usefull output data.
For more information you look at , this shiftout tutorials : REPLACEDLINK REPLACEDLINK flj1Mw REPLACEDLINK and then you need some resistors, some LED's, and the electromagnet we made in the earlier step :
Step 6: The Software Part Explanation of the Code 1
This Clock can be coded in different ways ! REPLACEDLINK in my exemple and to make it easier for me, i will use 3 shift registers for every digit 6 then in total and every 2 shift registers 74HC595 will be connected to 3 Arduino output Pins so, then basecly try to shift the sent data from one shift register to another !.

diy_Ying Yang LED Ceiling Island _test150,"Introduction: Ying Yang LED Ceiling Island
When my bedroom was redesigned I decided I wanted to add a little personal touch with an LED lit Ceiling Island, Using Sketchup I experimented with many different shapes until I stumbled upon the Idea of using Ying Yang, I experimented with the size of the circle and then ordered 12mm MDF which had to be 5 by 10 foot boards so that the size of circle fitted, I then worked out the perimeter would be and ordered a 10m string of RGBW LED's from online REPLACEDLINK https: online REPLACEDLINK rgbwplugandplaywaterproofrfcontrollerledstriplightingkitsmd REPLACEDLINK I cut out the Ying Yang from the MDF after some research I decided the best way to mount the LED's was at 90 degrees to the top of the MDF,",0
diy_Ying Yang LED Ceiling Island _test151,"so I used 3 thickness's of flexible plywood which I forced round the shape of the ying yang using blocks of soft wood which were screwed in place, the flexiply was then glued and clamped in place. I decided to cut a second ying yang to cover the underneath of the large piece. I attached the Ying yang to the ceiling using coach screws going into the rafters. I primed the MDF to stop the release of formaldehyde and coated in gloss white and matt black so that there was a contrast between the pieces, and the light was reflected as well as possible.
Step 1: Preperation
Decide upon how large the Ying Yang will be and order the correct size board I used 12mm MDF, using the formulas for",0
diy_Ying Yang LED Ceiling Island _test152,"perimeters of a circle find the maximum distance of LED's required, Strips are normally sold in 5m lengths, if it is slightly over this don't worry as they will be set back about REPLACEDLINK cm all the way around, and it doesn't notice if there is a small gap at the end. I spent a long time looking for the correct set of LED's. The ones I went for are expensive and others can be found much cheaper, however from the reviews of these there appeared to be safety hazards with cheap ones, and the programmability of the more expensive ones is better. I ordered two boards and did one half on each board. Order the LED's and Flexible ply along with any other wood required that you",0
diy_Ying Yang LED Ceiling Island _test153,"don't have around.
Step 2: Cutting the Large Ying Yang and the Covering Pieces
Using a tape measure, measure at least the radius of the circle from both edges. Using a piece of string attached to a small nail positioned at the point found above, attach a pencil when the string is the length of the radius and draw as much of the circle as possible onto the board, keeping the string taught the whole time. Draw a line through the centre and two points on the edge of the circle, this forms a diameter, try to make this parallel to the long edge of the board. Measure the length of the diameter and divide by 4 and change the length of the string to this value and use 1",0
diy_Ying Yang LED Ceiling Island _test154,"4 and 3 4 of the diameter as the centre for the two smaller circles. Using the same method as before draw the two other half circles, one going forwards the other going backwards be careful not to make the large circle too small, I made mine with the radius 990 REPLACEDLINK Draw around this shape 3 times and cut, you should end up with 4 Identical pieces. With two of them use a marking gauge to scribe 50mm into the board and recut, this creates the smaller covering pieces. On the edges that are facing downwards use a router to put a chamfer on the edge of the MDF, sandpaper would do but might take a while!
The process of creating the covering pieces may seem like a",0
diy_Ying Yang LED Ceiling Island _test155,"poor way of doing this, however it is the only way to do it that I have found, if you have other ideas please put it in the comments. If you decrease the radius to create a set of smaller ying yang, the curvature increases and they don't fit inside the larger ones Trust me I tried this!.
Step 3: Making the Supports for the Ying Yang
Using a circular saw cut the flexible plywood into 100mm 4 strips. This is the distance below the ceiling that the island will be. I advise using 3 layers of flexible plywood to give a solid upstand. Use a marking gauge to scribe 65mm in from the edge all the way round and 80mm in. The front face of the blocks to form",0
diy_Ying Yang LED Ceiling Island _test156,"the plywood will be placed on the back line. Cut a number of blocks that are 100mm high and use a plane to remove the corners on the outside edge, this is so that the contact area on the ply is reduced meaning that the bend will look smooth rather than blocky. Screw the blocks in place and glue the first layer of flexible ply in place, clamp and leave to dry. Towards the points of the ying yang, the ends of the plywood will meet, this should be done in the form of a mitre. Bend the next layer of plywood around the previous, glue and clamp. repeat this for the final layer, which should be level with the line that is 65mm in from the edge.",0
diy_Ying Yang LED Ceiling Island _test157,"I braced the ying and the yang by using two 4 x 1 timbers in the middle of the ying and the yang, these can also help provide extra fixing points.
Sorry some of the pictures were taken after I had mounted the pieces
Step 4: Attaching the Ying Yang
I cut some supports from tiling battons that were the distance from the floor to the MDF which were used to support the Ying Yang when positioning. I laid them out on the floor to get the positioning. I lifted the Ying into place and propped it using the supports I made earlier. this meant only two people were required to attach the Ying, rather two to hold it and one two drill and screw it into place, I used Coach",0
diy_Ying Yang LED Ceiling Island _test158,"Screws to attach the Ying to the ceiling, having found the rafters by knocking and making small holes with nails. I then used an impact driver with huge amounts of torque to bend the Ying to the ceiling as my ceiling is by no means level! I repeated this for the Yang. When the Ying Yang is attached screw the covering pieces into place lightly, do not countersink yet as this damages the integrity of the MDF and it wont hold the screws as well.
The image of the support and the level shows the amount of tension that was required to get the Ying anywhere close to level with the ceiling.
I cut a hole in the middle to allow the electrician easy access.
Step 5: Finishing the Ying Yang
I",0
diy_Ying Yang LED Ceiling Island _test159,"used an MDF primer to lock in the formaldehyde and to make it easier to paint. I filled the holes from the coach screws and then painted what was visible of the underside of the Ying Yang with matt black paint. I used white gloss paint on the uprights of the large pieces and the edges so that there was as much reflection as possible, I also used white gloss on the covering pieces. I used the black so that there was a clear difference between the two pieces. When all has been finished and LED's are installed, the holes for the screws in the covering pieces must be filled and then painted over. Leave plenty of time for this stage as you must allow each layer of",0
diy_Ying Yang LED Ceiling Island _test160,"paint to dry fully before repainting, the same applies for filling followed by rubbing back and painting. I advise doing as much painting as possible at ground level.
Step 6: Wiring
I used an electrician to wire in the LED's as it is going into the mains and I also had downward spots in the covering piece. On the set of 10m LED's I used the transformer is wired into the mains, so it was far safer to have this done professionally. The theory of the lighting is as follows, however I do not have a wiring schematic. Both strings of LED's are fed into one set of 5 cables, which was then fed into the radio controller, this was then wired into the transformer which was wired into the",0
diy_Ying Yang LED Ceiling Island _test161,"mains, this was in the loft space above the Ying Yangs, meaning that only the LED's are visible and very little of the wiring. There are simpler and smaller kits that are plugged into the mains and are simple to install, just secure the contacts into the correct terminals, plug in the transformer and Bobs your uncle. In this kind of configuration the black wire goes to V, the white to W, the red to R, the blue to B and the green to G, these have to be connected correctly or the lights will not work properly.
