#### Abstract
Research on malicious activity detection has focused on the code in the malicious files themselves, but the human
language text files that come with certain types of malware (e.g. ransomware) are often overlooked. We explore and
address this gap in malicious activity research. The contribution of this paper is demonstrating the viability of using
neural sequence classifiers to distinguish ransomware notes from other files. We show strong performance by tuning
on English language ransomware note text and various types of benign files, demonstrating accurate identification
of ransomware note text. We present an improvement over other methods of malicious text classification, with an
F1-score of 96.8% on content excerpts, compared to the highest F1-score of 92.0% on filenames in prior work
(Lemmou et al., 2021). We also revealed some unexpected insights into the characteristics of ransomware notes that,
to our knowledge, is novel in the published literature. Finally, we have made publicly available the dataset we curated,
for research purposes.
