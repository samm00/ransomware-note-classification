#### Abstract
The ability to identify files on a system that indicate malicious activity is an important technique to maintain system security. Research in this area has focused on the code in the malicious files themselves, but the human language text files that come with certain types of malware (i.e. ransomware) are often overlooked. In this paper, we present a novel method for ransomware note classification, applying natural language processing techniques to the study of malicious activity detection. We present our results which show strong performance by tuning a pre-trained sequence classifier on ransomware notes and other types of benign files, demonstrating accurate identification of ransomware note text.
