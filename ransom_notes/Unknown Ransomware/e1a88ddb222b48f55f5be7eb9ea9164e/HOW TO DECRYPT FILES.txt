All your information (documents, databases, backups and other files) this computer was encrypted using the most cryptographic algorithms.
All encrypted files are formatted .Crypted.
This form files '.Crypted' is a joint development American Hackers.

Reinstalling the OS will not change anything.
No system administrator in the world can solve this problem without knowing the password
In no case do not modify the files! But if you want, then make a backup.
